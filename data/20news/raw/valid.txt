17	well said mr beyer \) he he the great humanist speaks one has to read mr salah 's posters , in which he decribes jews as sons of pigs and monkeys , keeps promising the final battle between muslims and jews \( in which the stons and the trees will cry for the muslims to come and kill the jews hiding behind them \) , makes jokes about jews dying from heart attacks etc , to realize his objective stance on the matters involved

7	my whole point was not to say that the cars could n't go that fast , but that they should n't go that fast a family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph does n't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects , slightly wider tires , and a much larger engine that 's what the sho is a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine they did n't even bother improving the brakes the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho a big power plant stuck in a mid size sedan , with almost no other modifications i have real life experience with the mustang it handles like a brick \( except when you 're invoking oversteer , of course , something i personally avoid doing on the highway \) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph lots of accelleration but the rest of the car is not up to par i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind it did n't have to be the 911 it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several mercedes or audi models all of these cars are fairly expensive but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed this should be elementary there are a few things to keep in mind about europe , since you brought it up my autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand , but i believe the following to be true 1 drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here 2 the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than they are here , and usually include animal fences this makes them far more predictable than most us highways 3 not all of europe is the autobahn most places in europe have speed limits that are n't out of line with what we used to have in the us if my friends were n't lying to me they 're typically not much higher than 120km h i strongly suspect you wo n't find a lot of rabbit owners doing 120mph \( nearly 200km h \) on the autobahn , but i could be wrong some people have no respect for their own lives if you think so you sure do n't pay attention to my postings
7	even a minivan based on viper running gear \?
6	it must have 1 meg memory and support res 1024x768 \( even higher will be better \) if it has 9 15 pin ports and also supports ega cga , that 's better i will pay 30 1 \( shipping \) for it let me knoe if u have one like this
17	mack posted i know nothing about statistics , but what significance does the relatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period is so small \( at the end of 1371 \) \? this is not small a 2 7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69 2 7 approx 25 years can you imagine that \? most people seem not able to , and that is why so many deny that this problem exists , for me most especially in the industrialised countries \( low growth rates , but large environmental impact \) iran 's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture , deforestation , and water table drop similar to what is going on in california \( this year 's rain wo n't save you in stanford ! \) this is probably more to blame than the current government 's incompetence for dropping living standards in iran

3	i'm posting this for a friend that runs a bbs i'm not sure if its under dos or windows he is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it in another post , someone suggeted a digiboard , but did n't have too much info on it could someone give me information on any boards that they know of with the before mentioned configuration models specifications prices manufacturers thanks , rob

5	i consider twm style squeezed titles indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time , with no overlap and since two windows are n't enough , i have other xterm windows underneath them , with exactly the same positioning in case you 're not familiar with squeezed titles , here 's a crude picture figure 1 title a title b title c this is the window b hides window c , but body of the you can still see c 's title window , window a which is squeezed right figure 1 squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack , with easy access and 3 per stack is usually more than i really need , since i also insist on having a virtual wm the only problem is that the title location is static , that is , it is configured in twmrc , and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so is cumbersome and time consuming therefore , i have implemented f squeeze left , center , right functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button , you can change this title a this is the body of the window , window a to this title a this is the body of the window , window a okay so far , so good now , how the heck do i get them to put this into the next official twm , and the next tvtwm , and the next vtwm , and the next ctwm \? and the next xyztwm that i never heard of \? one way would be to post , in comp windows x , a description of this enhancement , together with an explanation of why i think it is a very good thing , and hope that someone reads it \) in case it is n't already clear why i think it 's a very good thing , look back up at figure 1 , and picture window a moved over on top of windows b and c now window a 's title hides window b 's title but when you hit f squeezecenter , the result is title b title a title c this is the body of the window , window a , which is on top the rest of this posting explains how to implement it , based on my x11r4 copy of vtvwm shar it 's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the executefunction \( \) routine in menus c ifdef shape case f squeezeleft static squeezeinfo left squeeze j left , 0 , 0 if \( deferexecution \( context , func , scr selectcursor \) \) return true tmp win squeeze info left squeeze setframeshape \( tmp win \) break and similarly for squeezeright \( j right \) and squeezecenter \( j center \) endif \( of course , you also have to define f squeezeleft in parse h and add f squeezeleft , fkeyword , f squeezeleft , and so forth to parse c in order to use these functions , add something like the following to your twmrc file button2 m s w v d r i t door f squeezecenter about a year ago , i posted this , but our news was broken and i think it did n't get out since then , blast has appeared in comp sources x , volume 19 , issue 41 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect , by chiseling away at an mwm style wide title better to have a twm style window manager , i think ralph betza \( fm \) , uunet ! ssiny ! gnohmon gnohmon ssiny com

10	so in other words , if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins , that 's immaterial because it was the coaches decision \? come on , joe , think about what you 're saying ! who they played is very significant why they played them is what 's irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much , much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders yes it does ! absolutely in the context of comparing two goaltenders of course , at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them and on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts but if you 're a coach deciding between two goalies , or a gm looking to make a trade , you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets i did n't see the second toronto game , but the first one was a defensive masterpiece there was nothing in that game to judge tommy soderstrom on because he was n't tested the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances , one he made a great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone , you have very little to go by but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the habs , you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a 1 goalie in action roussel does n't have a game like that in him do n't be so sure of that flyers management never says bad thing about roussel , but they do n't say too much on the good side either i 've seen at least two interviews where every time farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders , it was tommy this , tommy that , and oh , yeah , dom has played well too flyers in the nhl hall of fame kinda dull , really they handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza hut , but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid season had names like benning , kasper mostly random seat locations , some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos i do n't like that method since i 've seen guards help out people get things like lindros pictures , surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they 'd hold 'em for their buddies

4	x posted to comp sys mac hardware and misc consumers you 've heard about apple 's great new customer support program well , think again sometimes the only real support out there is what apple computer users can give to each other for another example , read on in the march 15th issue of macweek , ric ford described a two year effort by liam breck to document and bring to apple 's attention a problem with certain defective mice at random , the switches on these mice stick in the down position until clicked a second time , apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga65431 you 'll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you have such a mouse the problem is intermittent , but it 's not subtle liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem , and instead suggested that people contact apple 's customer assistance center directly \( macweek 4 5 93 p 64 \) when i called apple on march 23rd and described my defective mouse , i was eventually given a case number \( f83y \) and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty after waiting for three weeks , i called back today wondering where my new mouse was this time , i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse \( mb13831fc25 \) is not within the \( undisclosed \) range apple is willing to replace , and there is nothing i can do about it nothing , that is , unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apple 's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice please , if you have one of these mice , i need your help ! do n't assume you know what causes the problem \( there are lots of theories \) and start hacking around inside your hundred dollar mouse instead , let apple do it please take five minutes to call apple right now at united states 1 800 776 2333 canada 800 665 2775 uk and europe 33 1 49 01 49 01 australia 61 2 452 8000 japan and pacific 81 3 5411 8500 if the number is n't toll free , call collect describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse even if they refuse , insist that they register the details of your case , including your mouse 's serial number be firm network managers and user group leaders especially , please query your user bases everyone ask your friends and colleagues please do n't send mail to me or post yet another sticky button report , call apple directly ! if enough victims take the trouble to report this well known problem , apple will eventually be forced to respond if apple continues to find it easy to stone wall on this issue , do n't expect them to offer support when the next , potentially more serious mac defect is uncovered

15	if the papacy is infallible , and this is a matter of faith , then the pope cannot be wrong ! if , on the other hand , this is not a matter of faith , but a matter of church law , then we should still obey as the pope is the legal head of the church in other words , given the doctrine of infallibility , we have no choice but to obey this is a primary problem in the church today what you are saying is more or less heresy you might call it infallibilism it 's the idea that the pope is always right in everything he says or does this is virtually all over the place , especially in this country the pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well defined conditions when these conditions are not met , he can make mistakes he can make big mistakes a couple historical examples come to mind bishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the english catholic church at one point during his career , the reigning pope decided to install one of his nephews in an english see bishop grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body \( though maybe not in so many words you have to treat popes with respect , even when they are wrong \) the problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see , and probably never set foot there this would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd bishop grosseteste was quite right in what he did ! another example is that of pope john xxii , a pope of the middle ages he decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatific vision until the last judgement he decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the church though he did n't quite get around to defining it now there 's no way this is compatible with catholic doctrine the pope 's doctrine was criticised by many in the church he went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail , even in the end , he had to admit his mistake shortly before he died , he recanted his successor made the exact opposite idea a dogma of the church if you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of such subjects , such as st robert bellarmine \( a doctor of the church \) , you will find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fall into heresy or schism
15	koberg , just a couple of minor corrections here 1 \) the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues , in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to pentecostal teaching you are probably thinking of church of god in christ , the largest african american pentecostal denomination 2 \) i'm not sure what you mean by signifying believers but it should be pointed out that the assemblies of god does not now , nor has it ever , held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a christian the doctrine that traditional pentecostals \( including the a g \) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a christian in which one is baptized in the holy spirit that may be what you were referring to , but i point this out because pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a christian such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of pentecostals many pentecostals will quote the passage in mark 16 about these signs following them that believe but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you do n't pactice the signs you are n't saved 3 \) i know it 's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity , but i think you 've made some pretty big generalizations here do neo pentecostals only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but not tongues as revelatory with a message \? i 've never heard of that before in fact i would have characterized them as believing the same as pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of spirit baptism also , while neo pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non pentecostal churches they attend , they do have their own meetings and , in many cases , a whole church will be charismatic

0	there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively this definition does not include all atheists \( see the faq \) however , i \( for one \) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes , and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention , or anything spiritual , for that matter humans are not omnipotent , and neither is science however , science has one advantage theology does n't it is self correcting , with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent , simple picture of our universe science is no longer a bunch of separate branches , it is one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life , or our universe , is safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics , chemistry , biology , etc everything is random , nothing is determnined actually , determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question , and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question does not have any meaning , as far as individual human beings go if their apparent free will is an illusion , it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill , can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not \? this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence , it 's just a happy accident maybe who are we to tell \? it seems intelligence is useful when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere \? this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the systems that can start replicating will survive , those which do n't do n't make it \( recommended reading t o \) for an atheist , no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective \? i value events and things subjectively , from my perspective nature does not have values , because it does not have a perspective values arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective , it is easy to assume that other people also do , and if i think about what it would it be like in their position , i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens , in fact , it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful , allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity , too bill , have you ever read aristotle \? try his ethica nikomakhea \( sp \) for starters how then can an atheist judge value \? what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god \? on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned \? it seems that , in judging the values that motivate others to action , you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what in nature can serve that purpose \? what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values c s lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument is severely flawed some values , such as the golden rule , can have a rational basis some others , like the basic idea of wanting to live , has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour , and morality as well indeed , as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools , they also became better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools , but not against one 's own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the people together , under one god their god did not care much about people of other nations at the time of the nt , things were quite different the jews were under rule of an empire , and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles a new situation required a new morality , and along with it a new religion was born \( a mutation in a meme pool \) since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event , what difference could it possibly make what anyone does , religious or otherwise , there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he \( she \) just does n't like it that 's it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense it looks like you have n't bothered to read philosophy whenever there is an observer , there is a subjective point of view , which may value its existence and happiness \( even if that were just a result of some physical event \) , and other 's happiness , too , if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense , that is , without any observers or subjects , moral judgments lose their meaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this includes gods , too , their values are only their personal judgments , not absolute truths , since such truths do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others' existence morality is not property of humans alone chimps , dolphins and many other species show great care for each other dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning , a good deed indeed that you do n't like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you 've been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion , a virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact , there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well , and our senses can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility , but not a very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view \( which we all share \) and an objective point of view , which does not exist any observer or thinker , any personal being , has its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not , it does not cease to be subjective from a non observers non point of view , values do not exist neither does pain , or pleasure , or beauty , or love such things are inherently subjective once again , if god wants wives to submit to their husbands , or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown , or wants to punish us if we do n't , i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie , a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge , but i disagree with him , it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one 's own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so , you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god , for that matter i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else bill , take note absolute values must be independent of any being , including gods if god has a subjective viewpoint , it is his own point of view , and his morals are his own petri

15	just picked out this one point because it struck me why do you believe this \? muslims believe in many of the same things that christians and jews believe they believe jesus , while not the messiah , is a prophet this seems to me to be much closer to christianity than other religions are \( then again i tend to be somewhat liberal about others' beliefs \) this also relates to the serbian ethnic cleansing question i have been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few how can we stand by and watch innocent people , even people whose beliefs we condemn , if this is the case \( and do n't get me wrong , the things fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil \) , be tortured , raped \( the stories about that made me physically ill \) , and killed \? jesus loves all , not just those who love him back and he would advocate kindness toward them \( in the hopes of converting them , if that 's the way you want to put it \) rather than killing them i'm sorry i got off the subject here maybe i should have used a different title i did need to get this off my chest , however peace \( shalom \) , vera shanti hand over hand noye midway uchicago edu does n't seem so much \( vera noyes \) hand over hand is the strength of the common touch drop me a line if you 're in the mood rush , hand over fist i am also worried about this issue i 've made a posting under my own name earlier today i do not much want to discuss moslem beliefs here this is n't the right group for it their beliefs about jesus appear to come as much from the koran as the bible this means that while they honor him , what they think he did and stood for differs in many ways from christian beliefs about him but moslem beliefs are an appropriate topic for soc religion islam as i'm sure you know , many christians believe that you must accept christ in order to be saved while stanley 's comment appears to be anti moslem , i would assume he would say the same thing about all religions other than christianity

15	this subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory those who subscribe to biblical archaeology review will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a franklin mint ad \( bar is a great magazine , but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme \) in this ad , they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of nefertiti , giving the face a typical doll pink complexion the letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that nefertiti was a beautiful black queen this set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues , to the point where they had an article from an egyptologist titled was cleopatra black \? \( the answer to the title is no she was greek \) i have to say that i hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining i personally have seen only one blond haired jesus \( in the national shrine in wash dc \) , and i found it very jarring western representations vary enourmously , but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard , of a sort that can be found \( modulo the nose \) all up and down the mediterranean \( also , if what i remember is correct , the black madonna does n't represent a person with negroid features it is black because of an accident joe buehler \? \) in the presence of all those marble statues , one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair when one crosses the bosporus , the situation breaks down completely are turks white \? how about persians , or various groups in the indian subcontinent \? was gandhi white \? how about the arabs \? or picture nassar and sadat standing side by side and then there are the ethiopians those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that any of these people are white \( i e , of the racist 's race \) if i may risk a potentially inflammatory remark , one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other , i do n't think that this jesus was white thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did representations of jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine it seems awfully self serving to insist that jesus belongs to one 's own racial group
15	the last sentence is ironic , since so many readers of soc religion christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as josh mcdowell and c s lewis the above also expresses a rather odd sense of history what makes you think the masses in aquinas' day , who were mostly illiterate , knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people today \? if writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the cream of the crop , so to speak , could read and write if everyone in the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically accepting what they were told bill mayne

16	this was posted to the firearms politics mailing list hi folks wednesday marked day 2 , the beginning of the trial opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense , each side presenting its version of what happenned last august the prosecution argued that weaver and his family moved to idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the evil federal government the prosecution alleges that weaver sold federal agents sawed off shotguns and later failed to appear for trial despite repeated good faith efforts to get weaver to surrender peacefully , weaver refused the shootout erupted when weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing according to the prosecution , three people were taking an offensive action against an fbi helicopter when an fbi sniper killed vicki weaver the defense argued that weaver and his family moved to northern idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace they wanted simply to be left alone weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short barrelled shotgun \( and did not , as the prosecution alleged , want to become a regular supplier \) the defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest weaver when he would n't become an informant it is not specified explicitly , but i assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story we 'll know more as things develop the failure to appear in court happenned because weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date the shootout occurred when federal agent arthur roderick killed weaver 's dog that was in proximity to weaver 's son , samuel weaver then fired in self defense in the ensuing battle , federal agent william degan was killed \( when his gun was later found , there were 7 223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi automatic however , agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select fire this will have to be more fully explained \) finally , the defense claims that vicki weaver was only going to look at the body not recover \? of her son when she was cut down by an fbi sniper prosecution quote weaver wanted that confrontation , and he made that confrontation asst u s attorney kim lindquist defense quote the evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where randy weaver and kevin harris are charged with crimes they did n't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit gerry spence nice soundbite ! notes the idaho statesman claims that weaver supporters heeded a call from spence not to repeat yesterday 's protests outside the courthouse however , the local nbc affiliate again had footage on the 10 00 news with 5 supporters including tim again tim claimed he was a skinhead , who were ordinary , working class people he also claimed he was for white pride , not white power outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with bo gritz , who charged that the neo nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear randy weaver in an affiliated article carried in the idaho statesman , about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse these lawyers were present to watch gerry spence in action , and to perhaps learn something from him some tidbits spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son kent were volunteering their time to represent weaver because they believed in him spence , during his 90 minute opening statement , repeatedly walked behind weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders \( weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife 's death \) , and spence compared the sawed off shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 \( another good one ! \) today \( thursday , april 15th \) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence drew

ms myers there 's no coverage on the vessey meeting q why \? ms myers why \? it 's a closed meeting q what about the lunch \? ms myers the lunch \? no , there 's no coverage q is he meeting with any congress people today \? ms myers nothing scheduled q there are no meetings ms myers there are no congressional meetings today , no q has the president been given any information by the pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi \? any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject \? ms myers well , clearly , the report is the first order of business it 's high on the agenda on something that they 'll discuss i think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to vietnam today , but the president has n't drawn any conclusions about the report yet certainly , it 's something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first q did the president talk with any republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package \? ms myers he spoke with senator dole q how many times \? ms myers i believe once during the day and once last night q what was the outcome of that \? ms myers they 're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package q is it your impression that senator dole is in any way flexible on this \? ms myers well , i think we 're hopeful that we 're going to get some kind of jobs package through the senate , and we 'll continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement q did they discuss the vat tax \? ms myers i do n't know if that came up q can you check that \? ms myers sure q so what are they is the president offering to scale down his program is that what he 's trying to do , buy it down to where dole will sign on \? ms myers well , he 's trying to protect as much of it as he can but it 's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the senate and through congress now and as soon as we reach some conclusions on that , we 'll let you know but at the moment , he 's continuing to consult with members of congress including , obviously , senator dole q is he talking to anybody else \? ms myers i do n't believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday q is he talking to anybody today \? ms myers i do n't think anything is scheduled , but i would n't rule it out q we were led to believe that the president called mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package is that correct \? ms myers i think the president has contacted several people on russian aid i think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole the primary objective of the conversation was russian aid that was the first order of business , but it was both q in the president 's mind , are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the stimulus package , he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people \? has he made that argument \? ms myers i ca n't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made the president is obviously committed to both he liked to see a jobs package to the american people first but as you know , we outlined the details of additional russian aid last night in tokyo q but does the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid \? ms myers i think that the president is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package , to pass a jobs package , and we 're still hopeful that we 'll get some kind of jobs package through the congress q is it fair to say that the president is negotiating now with dole \? ms myers he 's discussing options with him q on the stimulus , is it your understanding that over the break some democrats , themselves , have left the support that they had earlier for the package , the stimulus package \? ms myers i think we still have wide support in the senate for the jobs package q but specifically , that you 've lost democrats other than shelby \? ms myers i do n't believe so there has n't been a vote q what about kohl \? q kohl and feingold \? ms myers there has n't been a vote yet and we 'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote , because we believe that a majority of the members of the united states senate support the package q if you 're were n't worried about kohl and feingold , why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day \? ms myers i think george pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded , or to lose funding if this jobs package does n't pass q no democrats \( laughter \) ms myers i 'll let you draw your own conclusions q does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republicans again today \? ms myers there 's nothing specifically scheduled , but again , i would n't rule it out q does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today \? ms myers what we 've done is we 're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state i think it 's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up , we 'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package q will you share those with us \? ms myers sure as we did yesterday q do you have copies of the ones you sent ms myers yes , we made those available yesterday and we certainly can continue to provide them today q dee dee , since yesterday 's questions and subsequent stories about the vat , what further consideration of this issue has been given \? ms myers nothing 's changed since yesterday i think the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on , and i do n't think we have anything to add to that q but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it can you tell us ms myers i think that there has been i'm not going to speculate on who supports it i think the president said that there has been some support among business and labor groups i do n't think he said he was directly contacted by them q are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this ms myers i think there 's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently , but i do n't think i want to add to that q in february , though , the president said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road what has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind \? ms myers i think as we said yesterday , it is something that the working groups are looking at they 're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the president 's health care plan the president has not taken it up yet , has not made a decision on it and beyond that , i do n't have anything to add q you have n't answered the question it was n't being considered by anyone in the white house after the president 's comments in february , and george reaffirmed that in a briefing q and then suddenly q what happened \? ms myers the working groups , as we have said throughout , we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across the board and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value added tax q but the president himself took this off the table , dee dee , and suddenly it reappears and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way what has happened in the meantime \? ms myers the president has not looked at this , it has n't been presented to him , again , yet the working groups are looking at it , as they 're looking at a wide variety of options , and no decisions have been made q and it raises the question of how independently the task force is working ms myers the task force was instructed to consider all options , and they 've taken that mandate seriously and they 're considering all options q but that 's not the impression that the president left in february the impression he left was that this was something that was long range , to be looked at 10 , 15 years down the road the clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table , not an option q if it changes i 'll tell you q bring him on q and you repeatedly referred to the president 's remarks , telling us that those were still in operation ms myers it 's changed , and we told you \( laughter \) q but that 's what alice rivlin 's comments and donna shalala comments were about i mean , that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers ms myers i would n't no , alice rivlin 's not a cabinet member , first of all second of all , it was not orchestrated , but clearly , they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it 's something that 's being looked at we confirmed that yesterday and i do n't have anything to add to that q is it because he has very few options \? q is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about \? in other words , has the president himself personally ruled it out and it 's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table \? or is it , in fact , back on the table , having been placed there by discussions with the president \? ms myers it is not the working group 's mission at this point to convince the president of anything it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context , and at this point he 's not that presentation has not been made , but it 's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on q they will present it to him as one of his options , though he specifically ruled it out \? ms myers correct q dee dee , is this more than a trial balloon \? is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation \? ms myers it 's simply a statement of fact the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform one of the options that they 're looking at is the vat q dee dee , when the working groups were examining this possibility , was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not \? ms myers i do n't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is i do n't know q who was telling you that it was not under consideration \? ms myers i was referring back to the president 's comments q have they discovered that the sin taxes wo n't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package \? ms myers no , there 's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan q i'm asking whether the projections ms myers there 's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured you ca n't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like and so you ca n't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know q dee dee , we 've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages ms myers correct q the question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package that is not a very difficult computation ms myers it is a question that you know that we 're not going to answer until there 's a number of options being considered it depends on how the package is structured the exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made q and when the president has been meeting with health care his health care advisors , which we are told he has been doing ms myers correct q they have never once said to him , these are your funding options , including the vat \? he has never heard the word vat in his ms myers i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they 're not daily , but the quasi regular briefings q well , you have ms myers i have not , other than to say that he 's not considered the vat and i think that is a true statement q no , but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option ms myers correct q that does n't mean he has n't heard about it ms myers i'm not going to get into the details of what 's discussed i think that statement stands for itself q specific , dee dee when you say he has n't looked at it , do you mean that he has n't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage , or has n't looked at it in general \? because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works , what the advantages are , the whole thing it sounds like ms myers but that was i think in chilicothe , if you go back to his remarks there , it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly , it 's something that he 's thought about in the broad context i mean , that was clear in chilicothe what i'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it 's something that he has n't considered yet it 's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options , and that no decisions have been made and i'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed q it 's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place you say that no option that the option has not been presented to him ms myers that is correct q do you stand by does the white house still stand by george 's statement in march that this will not be in the proposal \? ms myers no decisions have been made we have nothing to add to what 's already been said q let me follow up here do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday , that if any kind of vat were to be used or considered , that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive \? ms myers i'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if q but do you stand by the previous conversations in february that if there were to be a vat , i think the president said you 'd exclude food and energy ms myers i'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that has n't been made q was the president aware prior to donna shalala 's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups \? ms myers i do n't know specifically what q could you check for us , because that 's a real important credibility question \? ms myers sure q since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed , at the beginning and throughout , as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money were you all kept in the dark \? was the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you 've been denying that a vat tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option \? ms myers i think we 've said all that we have to say it is something the working groups are looking at the president has not made a decision about it yet and beyond that , i have nothing to add q well , sorry , dee dee , there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here yours primarily what we 're asking is , if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not , or if it 's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us ms myers i do n't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium ever ever q has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody told anybody to come out ms myers we 're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody i 've said what i have to say about this issue q all we were trying to find out ms myers i understand what you 're trying to find out and i 've given you the answers , helen q we 're trying to find out what changed what made it an option again that 's the ms myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options , and they are doing that q yes , but it was n't an option before how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the table \? ms myers it is something that they 're obviously considering and the president has not made a decision on q yes , but he took it off the table in february ms myers working groups are considering it they 'll present it to the president at some point and he 'll make a decision q why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table \? ms myers it 's clearly on the table q yes , but he took it off the table did he change his mind \? ms myers it 's back on the table , bill q did he change his mind \? ms myers he said this morning that he has n't made a decision about it he obviously knows that it 's on the table it 's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we 'll let you know q so he must have changed his mind , right \? ms myers at some point it will be looked at i mean , q dee dee , there 's like two options either he changed his mind or the working groups think they 're authority exceeds the president 's ms myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options they 've done that q are you going to put out his income tax \? ms myers yes , there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon his return will be available q will there be any kind of briefing to go through it \? ms myers no , nothing 's planned i think someone will be available , probably not in a briefing setting , but to walk you through the questions q we 're used to be walked line by line through the presidential tax forms ms myers i 've seen those briefings \( laughter \) q could we have one \? ms myers no , i do n't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing , but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it q did they file a joint form \? ms myers yes q when did he file it \? ms myers i believe it 's being filed today q dee dee , is there going to be a backgrounder for miyazawa \? ms myers no , there will be a readout after the meeting q no backgrounder today \? ms myers no backgrounder today q this is complicated stuff we need help \( laughter \) ms myers we ca n't give you taxes and miyazawa all in one day , it 's too confusing \( laughter \) q vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of force in bosnia they 've both said that , a , they never ruled it out , and b , it might be necessary now does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach \? ms myers there 's been no change in our policy towards bosnia we have always said that we 'd consider q but does that impact upon your decision \? are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you \? ms myers they 're people whose opinions carry weight certainly i mean , the president supports the process that they 've initiated but there 's been no change in our policy for bosnia , although we 're considering a number of options right now if the serbs do n't come back to the negotiating table , if they do n't sign on to some kind of an agreement , we will consider additional options , which we 've been saying regularly q one follow up question then \? we cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration why do you not set a deadline for the serbs \? can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table \? ms myers we 're continuing to put pressure on them every day q which does n't work so ms myers well , we think it is having some effect we 're going to continue to tighten sanctions as you know , we support the omnibus resolution we expect that to come to a vote on the 26th q you say it 's having an effect can you give us any documentation \? ms myers i 'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that q there 's been no you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia serbia , yes in bosnia , no ms myers i think that they 've had effect in serbia and we think they 've had some effect in bosnia and again , i 'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that , if you 'd like q we would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in bosnia we had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in belgrade , but we have n't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting can you provide something along those lines \? ms myers i will see what i can get you q on the extra russian aid that christopher announced this morning where is that money coming from \? ms myers we 'll have to work with congress on the details of that package q so that would be new money that you would hope to get \? ms myers yes , that 's new money , in addition to the 1 6 billion announced in vancouver so i assume that you all have seen the 1 8 billion package that was announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher q is n't there a concern , though , about offering something which you have to get in congress \? i mean , that was the concern with vancouver you did n't want to do that ms myers the concern with vancouver was to do something immediately , which required money that was already approved in the fiscal '93 budget what we 're looking at now is a little bit longer term plan to build on top of the 1 6 billion that we announced in vancouver this clearly will require congressional approval , or some of it will anyway , and we 're going to continue to work with congress to make that happen q to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by congress \? ms myers the president has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward q was christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through congress \? ms myers it was created in consultation with congress q in meeting with the law enforcement officials , is that does that have a set speech and a goal \? a direction \? ms myers yes , the president will talk about and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the president 's jobs package they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do q who are they \? ms myers it 's members or leadership from three organizations napo , which is the national association of police organizations ibpo , which is the international brotherhood of police organizations , i believe and iupa , which is the international union of police associations q will the fbi chief be there \? ms myers the fbi chief \? no q or any other federal law enforcement officials \? ms myers no , it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders q does the 1 8 billion announced today include the 400 million that 's in the fy '94 budget for disarmament \? ms myers no the nunn lugar money is separate q so this would be the 700 million that 's in the budget already , plus another 1 1 billion \? ms myers i believe all of this is on top of the 700 million already in the budget q is this going to be part of the supplemental or fiscal '94 ms myers we 'll work with congress on the exact funding mechanism on exactly how this will be paid for q this 1 8 billion on top of ms myers on top of 700 million on top of the 400 million nunn lugar money we announced earlier q and this is what prompted the president to call bob dole it was on this tranche , not on the previous money he was calling bob dole \? ms myers correct q is there a briefing on miyazawa \? ms myers there will be a readout after the meeting with miyazawa tomorrow q dee dee , on a totally unrelated matter , some republicans who are active in the u s chamber of commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce there are the town hall meeting the other night , the satellite and all of this relationship does the white house feel that you 're getting too close to these chambers of commerce \? ms myers that 's an interesting charge \( laughter \) after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the chambers , now there are those who would accuse us of being too close i think that 's interesting but no , we 're thrilled by the support we 've received from the national chamber and local chambers across the country and we 'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives q what 's the status of the president thinking about going to this democratic retreat \? ms myers it 's on his calendar i think he 'll almost certainly go q all three days \? ms myers we have n't figured out exactly when he 'll be there yet q is it open to coverage \? ms myers no , i believe the whole thing is closed q is he going to have any kind of address , statement , anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th \? ms myers we 're still looking at that we have n't made a final decision about how we 'll who will make a statement or what q any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders \? ms myers nothing is scheduled , but i would n't rule it out q what about an aids czar \? ms myers it 's coming q anything on the weekend \? q there 's been a suggestion that he 's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march ms myers no , i think this is something he 's been discussing for a long time appearing at the senate democratic retreat q the weekend \? ms myers weekend \? do n't know the only thing on right now is the radio address on saturday q any travel plans \? ms myers if it changes none right now q he 's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package \? ms myers no specific plans right now q what about mid week \? anything likely \? ms myers it 's possible yes , i think it 's likely that we 'll travel next week certainly the weekend q has he called thurmond about his daughter \? ms myers i do n't know i 'll check q going to name a drug czar this weekend \? ms myers this weekend \? i do n't believe so q and the radio address on saturday is that going to be focused on the stimulus package \? ms myers i'm sure it will the press thank you

13	there 's been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr burzynski 's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member 's father to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma this disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal after diagnosis in june 1992 , the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy the forum member checked extensively on dr burzynki 's track record for this disease he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive after the forum member 's father began dr burzynski 's treatment in september , all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis the patient 's oncologist , although telling him he would probably not live past december 1992 , was vehemently opposed to his trying dr burzynski 's treatment since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr burzynski 's treatment , she 's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments , saying if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it dr burzynski is an m d , ph d with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients , synthesized it , and administers it to patients with certain cancer types there is little understanding of the actual mechanism of activity

'it cant be that heavy' i thought well i was wrong as i sat on the st , both feet down , all i could think was big then i put one foot up heavy came to mind very quickly with cindy on the back was she on the back \? hard to tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road by 3000 rpm in second gear , all the weight seemed to dissappear even on bike with 4 1 miles on the odometer , slippery new tires , and pads that did not yet bite the disks , things seems smooth and sure cycles ! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride about 30 miles north of the computer concentration , about five miles north of where i95 splits away , 128 is a lighly travelled , two lane limited access highway it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton , manchester by the sea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there , it meets 133 , a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to andover on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots perfect , if slow , sport touring sections cindy has no difficulty with speed 3rd gear , 4th gear , purring along in top gear this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk lane changes were a new experience a big heft is required to move this thing responds well though no wallowing or complaint behind the fairing it was fairly quiet , but the helmet buffeting was non trivial top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless smooth , smooth , smooth not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of , but it is pleasant if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz the jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes its a down hill , reversing camber , twice reversing radius , decreasing radius turn a real squeeze is needed on the front binder the section of 133 we were on was tight , but too urban the st works ok in this section , but it shows its weight we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire a place where you could really find spencer , his house was about 15 miles down 133 after putting through traffic for a while , we turned and went back to 128 about half way through the onramp , i yanked cindy 's wrist , our singal for hold on tight head check left , time to find redline second gear gives a good shove third too fourth sees dod speed with a short shift into top on the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well , now it had 25 miles on it , so it was ok tried some high effort lane changes , some wide sweeping turns time to wick it up \? i went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat and stayed there when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering , i looked down to find an indicated 135mph not bad for 2 up touring beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit at the get off in a mile sign , i rolled off the throttle and coasted i wanted to re adjust to the coming slowness it was a good idea there were several manhole sized patches of sand on the exit ramp back to the slow and heavy behavior cycles ! is about a mile from 128 i could see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front heavy it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute my demo opinion \? heavy put it on a diet smooth , comfortable , hardly notices the dod speed i 'd buy on for about 3000 less than list , just like it is too much for the bike as it is
10	1992 93 los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski , daily news barry melrose 's decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year , the most fun time of the year , and i'm not , stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose 's choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made 21 saves in sundays 6 3 opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no 3 man behind rick knickle stauber had a 4 1 2 record and 2 98 goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no 1 job from hrudey knickle \? he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5 26 average , twice was yanked from games \( once for stomach cramps \) and has n't played since march 29 yet , when the series resumes wednesday , knickle will serve as hrudey 's backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too 3 what happened to no 2 \? stauber wondered not that i 'd be happy with no 2 , but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance , but melrose apparently is not convinced the 25 year old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings' goalie of the future , melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were , according to melrose a 7 2 loss to san jose on dec 26 an 8 3 loss to the new york rangers on jan 23 a 6 6 tie with detroit on feb 11 an 8 6 loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie , he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey , and he did n't do it , melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he is n't satisfied to be a backup i'm not blaming robb for the losses , but if you 're going to be no 1 , you 've got to be able to walk your talk you 've got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability , but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season 9 0 1 , struggled when the team hit a mid season slump , did n't play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster , then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody , including barry melrose , said stauber , a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989 , only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i 've been through the last four years two knee operations , a herniated disk in my back , shoulder surgery what more can i go through \? i obviously do expect a lot from myself , otherwise i would n't be here anybody who would disagree with that does n't know me i'm not saying barry does n't know me , but do n't say i 've been without expectations if anything , i'm a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i did n't play well , i get knocked down from maybe on to three \? it 's a bit of a jump , he said you 're almost no 1 , or if you play a good game you 're no 1 and if you do n't you 're no 3 \? why does jack nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75 \? can you explain that \? that 's what barry wanted me to explain to him , why i did n't come through when he counted on me i do n't know what i do know is , it 's a sport i 'll be there melrose 's goalie of the future statement does n't mean much to stauber before you know it , i 'll be 30 and there will be no future , he said game 1 of the kings flames playoff series drew a 4 2 nielsen rating on abc channel 7 here in la the kings averaged a 2 1 nielsen rating in the 10 regular season games aired on channel 5 around the nhl san jose fired coach george kingston , who lead the team to a 11 71 2 mark in their 2nd nhl season kingston was 28 129 7 over the past 2 years with the sharks former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager last nights games win 2 van 4 \( van leads 1 0 \) tor 3 det 6 \( det leads 1 0 \) stan willis \( willis empire dnet hac com \) net contact l a kings
17	they are news because they are the exceptions and the 'islamic holocaust' is much the topic of the day the historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920 , the armenian government ordered , incited , assisted and participated in the genocide of 2 5 million muslim people because of race , religion and national origin armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage , destroyed telephone cables , blew up bridges , blocked passes , set up ambushes , attacked security stations and small turkish outposts behind the ottoman army lines on the one hand , and on the other ruthlessly attacked turkish and kurdish villages , slaughtering the turkish population indiscriminately , women , children , old and young alike innocent muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death , or massacred with axes and swords , or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below widespread armenian massacres of innocent muslims took place in regions of van , kars , sivas , erzurum , bitlis , erzincan , mus , diyarbakir and maras the ottoman army , while fighting to prevent the russian invasion , also had to deal with armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind the armenian genocide of the muslims spread to all parts of eastern anatolia starting from late 1914 , armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in eastern anatolia , because the arena was left to the armenians almost every turkish town and village from erzincan up to azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by armenians and the turkish genocide has been documented by armenian , russian , american , british , ottoman , german , austrian and french journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood thirsty armenian genocide squads the ottoman army , liberating trabzon , bayburt , erzincan , erzurum , kars and other regions from the russians , saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt , people slaughtered , massacred the massacres conducted by armenians , which became a black stain for humanity , shocked and disgusted even the russian , british , german , austrian , french and american authorities almost every ottoman document is related to armenian massacres and cruelties the inhuman treatment , cruelties , atrocities , genocide by armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent moslem turkish and kurdish people , are sufficiently reflected in historical documents even today over seventy five years later , the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard source documents volume i \( 1919 \) document no 76 , archive no 1 2 , cabin no 109 , drawer no 3 , file no 346 , section no 427 \( 1385 \) , contents no 3 , 52 53 \( to lt colonel seyfi , general headquarters , second section , istanbul dr stephan eshnanie \) 'neues wiener tagblatt' vienna , 'pester lloyd' 'local anzliger' berlin , 'algemeen handelsblat' amsterdam , 'vakit' istanbul i have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of russians and armenians from turkish territories through armenia although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of armenian gangs , i have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the armenians at almost every step all the villages from trabzon to erzincan and from erzincan to erzurum are destroyed corpses of turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere according to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains , the first horrible and fearful events begun when the russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by armenian gangs the russians usually treated the people well , but the people feared the intervention of the armenians once these places had been taken over by the armenians , however , the massacres begun they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus , solve the nationality problem today i had the opportunity to meet austrian and german soldiers who had escaped from russian prison camps and come from kars and alexander paul \( gumru leninakan \) russian officers tried to save the turks and there were clashes between russian officers and armenian gangs i am now in erzurum , and what i see is terrible almost the whole city is destroyed the smell of the corpses still fills the air although there are speculations that armenian gangs murdered austrian and german prisoners as well , i could not get the supporting evidence in this regard , but there is proof of murdering of turkish prisoners of war dr stephan eshnanie serdar argic

11	it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you , and the escrow houses release your code to the cops , your code is now no longer secure it 's in the hands of cops , and while i am sure most of the time they are good , their security will not be as good as the escrow houses what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you , at the end of the wiretap , they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed , and replace \( for free \) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations \( which may be on tape , or disk , or whatver \) , as i understand the proposal i could be wrong , but i 've seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities as the eff noted , this raises further issues about the fruits of one bust leading to incrimination in other areas but is it any worse than the current unsecure system \? it becomes much worse , of course , if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption \( this is the main concern of most of us , i think the camel 's nose in the tent , etc \) and it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased , thus allowing greater access to central office records by the government \( the conversations being encrypted , who will object to letting the government have access to them , perhaps even automatically archiving large fractions \) this was one of the main objections to the s 266 proposal , that it would force telecom suppliers to provide easy access for the government one the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted conversations , now all it takes is one misstep , one violation that gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them ! do we want anyone to have this kind of power \? tim may , whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime

18	the dea and other organizations would have the american people believe that we are winning the war on drugs i'm going to dispel the propaganda that the dea is putting out by showing you the drug war 's real status to help prove my assertions i 've also posted two articles from usa today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups is on the rise if wod is working , as we 're led to believe , then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now the reality is , is that it has not gone down very much if anything , substance abuse is on the rise i'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem the following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled hello again , mary jane which appears in the current issue of time magazine \( april 19 , 1993 , p 59 \) law enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed perhaps because of the change of administrations , the marijuana lobby is out in full force , says robert bonner , head of the drug enforcement administration the fact is , they 're losing the battle in 1985 more than 23 of youths ages 12 to 17 said they smoked marijuana in 1991 that figure was 13 , and bonner says it is still falling bonner also offers a reminder that studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of nerve cells in the brain and lung damage the chart that follows was taken from the wednesday , april 14 , 1993 issue of usa today \( drug use up among u s eigth graders by mike snider , p 6d \) adolescents' choices drugs used by eighth graders in the last month estimated , per 100 students 1991 1992 pct chg alcohol 25 1 26 1 4 cigarettes 14 3 15 5 8 marijuana 3 2 3 7 16 amphetamines 2 6 3 3 27 lsd 0 6 0 9 50 cocaine 0 5 0 7 40 crack 0 3 0 5 67 source university of michigan institute for social research , 1993 report we are not winning the war on drugs i think you can see that one of the tactics that the dea employs to give people the impression that the war on drugs is being won is to selectively quote statistics only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down the excerpt from time magazine that i included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the dea attempt to deceive the public usage of one particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone up \( a k a substitution \) also , drug usage among one particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone up therefore , if one takes a look at the big picture , taking into consideration all the statistics , then it 's obvious that the so called war on drugs is being lost perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go , but if one factors in alcohol abuse , smoking , and use of inhalants , then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective for those of you who do n't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it 's not a drug agencies like the dea only go after illegal drugs this is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular the solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some not all drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits \( you wo n't drop dead after using it a few times \) and then couple this with a massive drug education program the reason why i think legalization is part of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government 's efforts to the contrary the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere \( e g , drug education \) additionally , legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts imho , the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them as you already know , people in the u s smoke a lot less than they used to this reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns , laws restricting where people can light up , warning labels on cigarette packages , taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption , and so on i propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out they are as follows drugs being sold must come with clear , concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in all drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement make it a felony to sell drugs to minors \( people under the age of 18 \) anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible this agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs something that is a fairly serious problem now i'm sure that many of the things i 've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup nevertheless , i thought it was a good idea to give my two cents \( actually a buck and a half \) all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod go ahead and tear into my post i'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame \) \) \) btw , i posted the articles from usa today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on lsd usage among youths something which i noticed some posters to this group were interested in scott kennedy , brewer and patriot

11	prof denning 's description of skipjack mostly omitted chip structure the clipper chip contains a classified 64 bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses 80 bit keys \( compared with 56 for the des \) and has 32 rounds of scrambling \( compared with 16 for the des \) it supports all 4 des modes of operation throughput is 16 mbits a second f , an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips n , a 30 bit serial number u , an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the key k and message stream m \( i e , digitized voice \) are then fed into the clipper chip to produce two values e m k , the encrypted message stream , and e e k u n f , a law enforcement block three questions 1 \) it looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4 64 bits of output e m k 64 bits e k u e 80 bits 128 bits e e k u , n f e 128 30 bits 192 bits do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time , or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning \? all 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth limited applications like cellular phones \( or even regular phones over 2 \) how do the 4 des modes interact with the two part output \? do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block , or also to the wiretap block \? or , if the wiretap block is only transmitted at the beginning , does it get incorporated into everything through feedback modes , but not during ecb mode \? 3 \) does the clipper chip check the wiretap block itself \? does the block have to be present at all \? since the receiving chip does n't know the transmitter 's u , it presumably ca n't check the validity of e k u , so it 's limited to checking the form of the wiretap block , and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness \( unless there 's some sort of back door structure that lets it recognize a valid e k u \) in that case , can you replace the wiretap block with a different wiretap block , presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention \? \( the chip wo n't do it , so you postprocess the output \) regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key paranoid people can use someone else 's serial number on the other hand , if i could think of that solution so easily , presumably the nsa could too have they done something to block it , like use message encryption that 's really e m k , u , n \? thanks !

11	secrecy in clipper chip the serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message presumably the protocol can be recovered \( if by nothing else , differential analysis \) postulate if you will , a chip \( or logic \) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel the purpose of this chip is twofold 1 \) transmit channel the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the system key 2 \) recieve channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable \( assuming the serial number is necessary for local operation \) this has the net result of hiding the serial number this gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large , making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number without knowing the system key , you could lie about the serial number , but risk detection of the lie if you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number

and 35 khz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor \( macuser aug 1992 158 176 \) older machines that supported color se 30 , ii , iix , and iicx had only 8 bit color in rom and needed a software patch to use 32 bit color \( macuser special 1993 28 29 \) to keep costs down and speed up most macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built in , but most of those can be expanded to display 24 bit color presently quickdraw is optimized for 72 dpi display quickdraw qx will change this in addition , quickdraw allows , in macs with a nubus slot , more then one monitor to be used in any combination , from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures vram video ram standard for present non

all macs since the 128k stereo sound became standard with the se 30 ibm even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware \( nan zou \) , the use of drivers bypassing bios , video hareware inconsitancies see super vga below and nonstanderzation of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware , os and program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question \( faisal nameer jawdat \) in addition , ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present \( matt healy \) nor a standardized screen drawing toolbox like mac 's qd as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes , especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program , os , print driver and monitor card that editing 32 bit pictures regardless of color mode , os , and monitor type card combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with an ibm for example , one cannot edit a 32 bit color picture done on a os 2 486 with a svga monitor on a 386 with vga 18 bit

svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units , but things are still a mess video is either 512k 1990 or 1m today , resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common , newer ones since 1990 have the sierra hicolor ramdac , giving 15 bit 32 , 768 colors at

details scsi 2 10 devices per scsi controller in scsi 2 mode scsi 2 is fully scsi 1 compliant and 8 bit scsi 2 tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi 1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that 16 and 32 bit scsi 2 do transfer speeds are 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit , 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit , and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst 32 bit wide and fast since 8 bit scsi 2 can use scsi 1 software drivers and hardware at 8 bit scsi 2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast scsi 1 16 bit fast scsi 2 requires a scsi 2 software driver and scsi 2 electronics but can still use the scsi 1 ports wide 16 bit and 32 bit scsi 2 require a different scsi port , electronics , and software driver from scsi 1 which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces mac scsi asynchronous scsi 1 built in standard since the plus even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers , the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces as a result present scsi 2 macs use 8 bit scsi 2 as a fast asynchronous scsi 1 presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi 2 controller chip built in \( digital review , oct 21 , 1991 v8 n33 p8 \( 1 \) \) though they lack some other parts of the hardware , like the wide scsi 2 port interface since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi 2 , older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu rumor some cyclone macs june will come with a wide fast scsi 2 port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager ibm scsi scsi 1 is not too wide spread yet , generally not bundled with systems , except as add on eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable like the mac , 8 bit scsi 2 is used as a very fast scsi 1 by most controllers out there unlike the mac , ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi mac memory expansion with a few exceptions the mac has used non parity 30 pin 8 bit simm memory expansion since the plus while 32 pin 9 bit parity simms could be used in these macs , only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm types are called 32 pin simms the iifx used 64 pin parity simms the lc iii , c610 650 and q800 all use a new 72 pin simm that is accessable by 32 bits at a time and is used in ibms the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing reading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is since macs made before feb 15 , 1993 managed memory baced on data path , simms had to be installed in pairs 16 bit or in sets of 4 32 bit the centris 650 and quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is 'interleaved'

most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the 'patches'

software network printing is not controlled by the system , but is mostly implemented by the actual program , therefore performance varies from one software program to the next windows 3 x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue , but it always lists printers as active even if they are not this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net , because there 's no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now windows for workgroups is more mac like and intelligent about this os 2 mac like the os deals with printers , with apps making calls to the os printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do not have wysiwyg printing this is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the os involved price issue this is very dynamic with mac providing more build in features than ibm and ibm being more 'get only what you need' then mac and price wars by

because there is none like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i am writing by the way , that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people for nearly one thousand years , the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in 1914 the armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects 2 5 million turks and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years , turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye today , x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia today , x soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds you may assert whatever you wish ditto the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians , government and international political leaders , such as u s ambassador mark bristol , and still anxiously awaiting so the list goes on and on and on i'm still trying to find out about those jews in latvia can you post those documents pleeeeeeease , mr argic \?

13	as promised , below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms pressure point massager a2623 109 to order or receive a catalog , call \( 24 hours , 7 days \) 1 800 345 3371 or fax at 1 800 345 4021 note when i ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was 179 , not 109 when i received it , i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a 70 difference in price i called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return in fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory \( i received this one in 3 days \) , he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck , shoulder and back pain \( if i were a building , i would be described as structurally unsound \) \) i have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away if , for whatever reason , i do not exercise for a while \( illness , not enough time , lazy , etc \) , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain even with exercise , i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache \( sometimes confused with a sinus headache \) over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub occipital muscles in particular \( the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull \) , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage , not vibrate , my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now , and love it the base unit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle , about 3 3 4 high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about 1 1 2 in diameter and protrude about 2 1 2 above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end , rather than centered \( see figure below \) they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it for the neck head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by \( if laying down \) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired \( i'm typing this over an extended period of time \) , and i do n't have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me for my back , i sit in a high backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged , and lean back lightly \( or not so lightly \) against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine , i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \( with the balls , position \( against a wall or door \) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them \) the tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets \( painfully \) in the way if i do n't pin it up first as far as i'm concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely i 'll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles , i'm more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles , however , i overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped after that , i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point , the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging \( just a few minutes at a time \) to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although i cannot vouch for its durability \( it seems pretty sturdy \) , since i 've had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls before exercising \( and maybe after , too \) i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me this is the 1st product i 've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since 1976 it contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i 've seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i'm only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists \( no big surprise here \) \) i consider many of those products to be rip offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this , but it 's the kind of info i would like to know before ordering something thru the mail

3	about two months ago i purchased the adaptec asw 410 driver for use with a cd rom drive at the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation i had with my adaptec scsi controller said that this is the driver to be used with cd rom drives since then i have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver \( i think it 's called ezi scsi or something \) i was n't too fussed about this until i upgraded by cd rom drive from a sony cdu 541 to a sony cdu 641 i now find that the audio mode will not work i assume it is not being handled correctly by the asw 410 driver so , should i chase adaptec for an upgrade \? if so does anyone know their fax number \? any assistance appreciated regards btw everything else works fine , certainly seems that sony have caught up with the rest with the 641

windows 3 1 enhanced mode the windows 3 1 install program should automatically configure dos and windows for use with the adaptec 1542 however , just in case something went wrong , i'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get windows 3 1 working with the 1542 also , you may have noticed that installing windows 3 1 makes your pc run much slower , even when you 're not running windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called , windows 3 1 runs slowly msdos configuration the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your config sys and autoexec bat files if you follow the instructions , you 'll notice that you 'll need to use double buffering with smartdrive \( this is the default setup \) you 'll also notice that your system runs much , much slower in both windows and msdos see the section called , windows 3 1 runs slowly , for some ways of speeding your system up windows configuration to get the adaptec 1542 to work with windows , make sure that the 388enh section of the system ini file contains the entry virtualhdirq off i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry to system ini , but i'm not sure if this does n't work for you , you might want to try adding some more lines virtualhdirq off systemrombreakpoint false emmexclude a000 cfff \( you probably do n't need the above lines , though \) the systemrombreakpoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like qemm 386max \( only needed if you use such programs \) windows 3 1 runs slowly once you do get windows 3 1 running with the 1542 , chances are that your system is running much slower than before if it 's not , it 's probably because 1 you happen to be using aspi4dos sys version 3 1 in your config sys file congratulations this appears to be a winning solution 2 you are very lucky whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen if your system is running much slower than before , this is almost definitely caused by smartdrive with double buffering according to the windows documentation , and the microsoft technical note q81808 \( smartdrive double buffering required with aspi4dos sys \) , you must use smartdrive with double buffering enabled while this works , it really slows down your pc i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a factor of 5 \( five \) as i consider this unacceptable , i looked for other solutions unfortunately , you cannot just disable double buffering if you do , windows 3 1 in enhanced mode will not work , and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows 3 1 what you can do is one of the following 1 use other drivers that provide double buffering it is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double buffering , or by a bug in smartdrive 2 use a driver that provides vds services \( vds stands for virtual dma services \) this is a standard , which is supported by windows 3 1 , that allows bus mastering disk controllers \( like the 1542 \) to work with windows after trashing my hard disk countless times , i found the following solutions , none of which require using smartdrive \( note , however , that i am now getting occasional parity errors , which are probably not caused by these solutions , but might be see below \) while the following does not require smartdrive , using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended , as this makes windows run much , much faster 1 if you do not have the aspi4dos sys driver , or you do not need aspi functions \( for controlling a cdrom , tape drive , more than two physical hard disks , etc \) , you can add the scsiha sys driver to your config sys file , e g driver c scsiha sys v386 \( windows needs the v386 option \) this driver must be loaded into low memory \( it cannot be loaded into high memory \) , and it occupies about 16 20k as of november 1992 , the scsiha sys driver could be obtained from the adaptec bbs at \( 408 \) 945 7727 \( hopefully , it 's still there \) 2 if you need aspi functions and have the aspi4dos sys driver , version 3 0 or 3 0a , you can use both the aspi4dos sys and scsiha sys drivers in your config sys file , e g driver c aspi4dos sys driver c scsiha sys v386 amazingly enough , the scsiha sys driver can also be loaded high \( assuming you have dos 5 0 \) i would have thought that this would crash my system , but it does n't i asked adaptec 's technical support about this , and they said that loading scsiha sys high should be fine as long as aspi4dos sys is loaded low on my system , not using scsiha sys with aspi4dos 3 0a would occasionally cause windows 3 1 to crash upon restarting or exiting windows , with the additional result of a corrupted disk \( some of my c windows grp files would be corrupted \) for me , these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from progman exe the default windows shell , and vice versa this is the reason scsiha sys may be necessary i have absolutely no idea if scsiha sys is necessary with versions of aspi4dos earlier than 3 0 note that many people can use aspi4dos 3 0 or 3 0a without scsiha sys they do not seem to have any problems at all i consider these people lucky others , like me , have had all sorts of problems 3 in my opinion , the best , but not necessarily the easiest , solution is to upgrade to aspi4dos 3 1 the scsiha sys driver is no longer needed unfortunately , while you could get previous aspi4dos upgrades from the adaptec bbs , the aspi4dos 3 1 driver is not available from the adaptec bbs as far as i know , there are only three ways to get a copy you can buy the new \( as of november 1992 \) adaptec ez scsi driver kit , which supposedly includes aspi4dos 3 1 as well as other drivers , such as cdrom drivers i believe the list price is around 75 if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi4dos , you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for around 30 a copy of aspi4dos 3 1 is included in central point pc tools 8 0 for msdos note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories note further that only aspi4dos is included the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included this is where i obtained my copy of aspi4dos 3 1 note , however , that i am now getting occasional parity errors with windows in all probability , defective hardware in my pc is causing this , as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above solutions however , because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses , there is a very small , but definite , possibility that the parity errors are driver related \( for example , changing the bus on off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this \) i 've run various memory tests for hours at a time , and these tests have found no problems this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements , which cause parity errors during disk transfers \( this is why the memory tests did n't find any problems the problems show up only under disk i o \) however , i'm mentioning this just in case it is n't a hardware problem floppy controller based tape backup devices there are two possible problems with using the adaptec 1542 with a floppy controller based tape backup device , such as the colorado memory systems jumbo 250 1 tape backups restores can take a very long time the tape drive constantly starts , stops , starts , stops , etc 2 tape operations may be erratic , or encounter too many tape errors \( this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542 however , i 've heard of other people having similar problems , and so i'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542 \) tape backups restores take a long time if you have a floppy controller based tape backup device , you may have to adjust the adaptec 1540 1542 bus on off timing for best results when using the tape drive normally , while doing a tape backup or restore , the tape drive motor should be continuously running , with only an occasional pause however , the default bus timing on the adaptec 1540 1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop , start and stop , every few seconds this causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive \( however , note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean \) this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much , much longer than necessary the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to transfer data in memory to from the tape drive , and the adaptec uses dma to transfer data in memory to from the hard disk the floppy dma needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma , the tape drive stops , rewinds a bit , and restarts \( once enough data is eventually fed to it \) the default bus timing on the adaptec \( which is really dma timing \) is too large for example , when a backup is done , data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory , and then from memory to the tape because the default timing on the adaptec hogs the memory too much \( too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory \) , not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive as a result , the tape drive constantly starts and stops , because data is not fed to it quickly enough the solution is to change the adaptec 's bus on off timing the default factory setting is 11 microseconds on , and 5 microseconds off the bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2 4 microseconds this can be done in one of two ways if you have aspi4dos , you can use the n option for example , i use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds , which means that i use the following line in my config sys file device c aspi4dos sys n4 note that there is no space between the n and the 4 if you do n't have aspi4dos , your only recourse is to try to find a program called setscsi exe , which is very difficult to find the reason is that adaptec , for reasons of their own , does not seem to want this widely distributed i once asked someone who worked for adaptec , and they asked me to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet , you could try using archie to hunt down a copy i believe that there are a couple of sites that have it if you do find a copy , you run it like so setscsi n 4 this adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds running setscsi exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi exe if you use aspi4dos setscsi exe crashed my system if aspi4dos was loaded i could use setscsi exe with scsiha sys , however do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds , or increase it above 11 microseconds if you lower it too low , the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower for me , 4 microseconds works fine this value may work fine for you , or you may have to adjust it downwards a little once you 've lowered the bus on timing , tape backups and restores should run faster also , do not experiment with the bus on off times \( with the other options that i have intentionally not described \) , unless you know what you are doing bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse , by starving memory refresh a program called bustifix exe exists on the adaptec bbs unless this has been upgraded since i last checked \( which has been a while \) , this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on off times for the 1540 1542 and others however , when i tried running this program with my 1542a , my system crashed at the time , i was running scsiha sys , and i did n't check to see if there was a conflict with it maybe this old program works only with the 1542b , although the docs say that it works with the 1542a \? erratic tape operations or too many tape errors this problem may or may not exist although it existed on my system , a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it however , i 've heard of other people having similar problems , and so i'm mentioning this just in case it is n't a hardware problem just on my 1542 symptoms of this problem , which persists even after cleaning the tape head 1 backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors , resulting in an aborted tape backup 2 tape backup works , but the tape compare fails 3 the tape drive starts , stops , starts , stops , etc much too often unlike the above mentioned problem \( tape backups restores take a long time \) , where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds , this kind of starting stopping occurs every few 10 20 seconds or so 4 fastback plus 3 1 does not find see any tape backup devices other programs , like central point backup and the cms jumbo software \( assuming that you have a cms jumbo 250 tape drive \) can find see the tape drive , but fastback plus 3 1 cannot 5 too many tape read errors although i do not know what is causing this problem , i discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it a few months ago , i upgraded my motherboard , which contained an integrated floppy controller as i already had a floppy controller on the 1542 , i initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller after a while , i decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard when i did this , the tape drive \( a cms jumbo 250 \) reliability increased dramatically , and fastback plus 3 1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive i do n't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542 on the one hand , the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 , which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542 on the other hand , the tape drive did n't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller , but it did work when attached to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542 i did change floppy drive cables , and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables i do n't know what the cause really is however , if you 're having similar problems , you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound , and this is typically done using dma like the tape drive dma , the adaptec 's dma can conflict with the sound card dma unlike that of the tape dma , this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error \( your system crashes with a parity error message \) what happens is that , data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec , memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough , which causes a parity error usually , getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system in this case , however , the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware i 've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound , and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity \( e g , higher sampling rate , recording in stereo , recording using 16 bits instead of 8 , etc \) like the tape drive solution , the solution here is to lower the adaptec 's bus on timing see the section on tape drives for information on how this is done note , however , that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem \( i e , some software is inefficient \) disk caches , the speed of your hard disk , and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this miscellaneous info this section contains miscellaneous hints , tips , and rumors much of it is merely information that i 've heard or read about , and have not verified i believe that the following information is correct , but i'm not sure use it at your own risk with qemm 6 00 , 6 01 , and 6 02 , you need to specify the db parameter \( e g , db 2 \) , unless you are using the aspi4dos driver if you do n't , qemm will crash hang at bootup although the qemm manual mentions this , the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the qemm command line \( at least , this occurred with the qemm 6 00 install program i have n't tested any other version \) earlier versions of qemm probably need this parameter , but i'm not sure \( i 've never used a version earlier than 6 00 \) if you use aspi4dos , you do not need to give qemm the db parameter some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size to support hard disks with capacities over 1gb , you need to get a new rom bios from adaptec i'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542bs being sold by adaptec to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542 , you need a scsi cdrom drive and some drivers note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces \( non scsi \) these drives cannot be used with the 1542 you have three choices for cdrom drivers \( i have no idea how well the following solutions work , or even if they work the following is secondhand information \) 1 you can buy adaptec 's ez scsi driver package , which lists for something like 75 if you already have older adaptec drivers , you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around 30 contact adaptec for details the ez scsi package supposedly contains everything that you need 2 you can buy the corelscsi ! driver package , which is made by the same people that make coreldraw ! this package contains cdrom drivers , scsi tape drivers , worm drivers , etc i do not know the list price , but i 've seen this package sold for around 80 90 note that corelscsi ! does not come with the aspi4dos driver , which is needed if you do not already have aspi4dos , you may be better off getting adaptec 's ez scsi instead 3 this method is obsolete , as the following drivers have been obsoleted by adaptec 's ez scsi kit , but i'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers you can use the drivers in the adaptec asw 1410 kit \( aspi4dos \) and the asw 410 kit \( aspi cdrom drivers \) you will have to get a copy of mscdex exe \( a high level cdrom driver \) , if it is not included in the asw 410 kit , but this is available from several bulletin boards to use a scsi tape drive with the 1542 , you need software that knows how to talk to a scsi tape drive software that i 've heard about are \( again , like the above section on cdrom drives , i have no idea how well the following solutions work , or even if they work the following is secondhand information \) 1 central point pc tools 8 0 for msdos supposedly supports a large number of scsi tape drives it comes with scsi drivers \( aspi4dos 3 1 \) as well as central point backup 2 the corelscsi ! driver package contains a scsi tape backup program \( see the above section on cdrom drives for more details \) however , note that corelscsi ! does not come with , but requires , aspi4dos i 've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations 1 1542 scsi controller with hard disk rom bios 2 1542 scsi controller w bios and adaptec aspi drivers 3 1542 scsi controller w bios , adaptec aspi drivers , and corelscsi ! drivers programs i imagine that adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration 4 1542 scsi controller w bios and ez scsi drivers \( including aspi drivers \) those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4dos driver \( you need this driver before you can use this program \) i 've never used this version of gnu tar , but i 've heard that it works \( i do n't know how well , though \) if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet , a copy can be found on wsmr simtel20 army mil and mirror sites pd1 msdos dskutl aspibin zip 67841 920131

idea if a copy can be found on compuserve unixforum might have it , if any forum does as far as msdos is concerned , the 1542a and the 1542b controllers are the same with msdos , the 1542a should work as well as the 1542b however , the hardware for these two boards is not 100 identical , and there is at least one \( non msdos \) program that initially did not work with a 1542a , but did work with a 1542b \( bsd386 a 386 version of bsd unix \) in case anyone 's curious , here 's an edited copy of my config sys file files 40 buffers 40 break on stacks 10 , 256 device c sys dev aspi4dos sys d n4

11	archive name cryptography faq part07 last modified 1993 4 15 faq for sci crypt , part 7 digital signatures and hash functions this is the seventh of ten parts of the sci crypt faq the parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest we do n't have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so do n't ask notes such as `` kah67 '' refer to the reference list in the last part the sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet news answers cryptography faq part xx the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci crypt , sci answers , and news answers every 21 days contents what is a one way hash function \? what is the difference between public , private , secret , shared , etc \? what are md4 and md5 \? what is snefru \? what is a one way hash function \? a typical one way hash function takes a variable length message and produces a fixed length hash given the hash it is computationally impossible to find a message with that hash in fact one ca n't determine any usable information about a message with that hash , not even a single bit for some one way hash functions it 's also computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the same hash a one way hash function can be private or public , just like an encryption function here 's one application of a public one way hash function , like md5 or snefru most public key signature systems are relatively slow to sign a long message may take longer than the user is willing to wait solution compute the one way hash of the message , and sign the hash , which is short now anyone who wants to verify the signature can do the same thing another name for one way hash function is message digest function what is the difference between public , private , secret , shared , etc \? there is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of concepts when an algorithm depends on a key which is n't published , we call it a private algorithm otherwise we call it a public algorithm we have encryption functions e and decryption functions d , so that d \( e \( m \) \) m for any message m we also have hashing functions h and verification functions v , such that v \( m , x \) 1 if and only if x h \( m \) a public key cryptosystem has public encryption and private decryption checksums , such as the application mentioned in the previous question , have public hashing and public verification digital signature functions have private hashing and public verification only one person can produce the hash for a message , but everyone can verify that the hash is correct obviously , when an algorithm depends on a private key , it 's meant to be unusable by anyone who does n't have the key there 's no real difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key a shared key is n't published , so it 's private if you encrypt data for a friend rather than ``for your eyes only'' , are you suddenly doing ``shared key encryption'' rather than private key encryption \? no what are md4 and md5 \? md4 and md5 are message digest functions developed by ron rivest definitions appear in rfc 1320 and rfc 1321 \( see part 10 \) code is available from ftpmd note that a transcription error was found in the original md5 draft rfc the corrected algorithm should be called md5a , though some people refer to it as md5 what is snefru \?

11	if clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones , a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications \( specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats \) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user , and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed once a suitable collection of devices is stolen , criminals can communicate with impunity \( assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow \) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means because life is cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property \( luxury cars \) , it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property \( a cipher cellular phone \) just as we have seen in the past with blue box technology , and in the present with modified cellular phones , we can expect to see among high stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days the high stakes criminals will pay the life is cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days , a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days there will be a continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies in other words , clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct , vicious , and persistent threat to the general public on the other hand , if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non ciphered network , the communication will at least stand out as being unusual , and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation finally , because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments , there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny \( once some criminal act is discovered , and the instruments involved have been identified \) while recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks , it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks the existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse

5	actually , info qdeck com is our customer service department if you have technical questions , you can write to support qdeck com i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network itself to give you a real world example , here at quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell file servers , and each other it 's not too much of a load on our ethernet \( with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20 30 people on each segment \) if you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some slowdowns because you 're now on \( effectively \) a 3 3 mhz 486 of course , dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run \( by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing \) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again \( this time from network bandwidth \) it all really depends on what the programs are doing \( ie you 're going to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also \)

11	my earlier argument that clipper will encourage state and local cops to commit criminal acts is largely moot , now that we 've learned that the fbi will perform the actual tap it will encourage the fbi to commit \( even more \) criminal acts , but that 's not the point here but this gives another avenue of attack on the clipper proposal when the eff aclu cpsr foia requests are made , they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed \( or even already budgeted \) for the fbi to service tapping requests for now and the projected future from these figures , estimate the number of clipper tap requests the fbi is expecting publish this figure compare it on a per capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected also estimate how expensive it would be for the fbi to install more clipper tapping stations , and how rapidly they could be built and installed ie , get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future might be a mite disturbing for j q public to know these things and despite all the technical details btw , thanks to those who 've been providing them ! , we still do n't know 1 \) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated \( though it is n't too hard to guess a good scheme \) 2 \) how the results will be securely transmitted \( fed ex the audio tapes \? \) 3 \) how privacy will be re established when an investigation is complete

7	i'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter \? i 've been doing it my self over 200 , 000 miles , on my current toyota truck i 've got over 150k i 've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use \? on some old pieces of junk i drove , the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift , except clutchless to date i 've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords a chevy some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker easier they where to shift my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window , i lightly press the accelerator try agian i 've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms \( 4000 7000 \) i also skip gears some times using 1 3 5 , 1 2 4 5
3	xga or xga 2 \? for the original xga you just need something that can do 1024x768 at 45 90hz interlaced \( just tell them 8514 compatible and they should get the idea \) for the xga 2 , get what you like i prefer multi syncs like the ibm 6319 , the necs or even a fixed frequency monitor like my home viewsonic 6 i like the multisyncs because it 's easy to run them in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced , or at higher modes like 1360x1024x16

4	i think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general the processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things i mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without giving is operational conditions \? can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to its fpu and 486 does , can you say that 040 is still faster \? anyway , i hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor or how fast a processor is based on its name , because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict our arguements to , for example , pure processor architectural issues or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design , then we can get somewhere with our discussions chung yang

16	last year the us suffered almost 10 , 000 wrongful or accidental deaths by handguns alone \( fbi statistics \) in the same year , the uk suffered 35 such deaths \( scotland yard statistics \) the population of the uk is about 1 5 that of the us \( 10 , 000 \( 35 5 \) \) weighted for population , the us has 57x as many handgun related deaths as the uk and , no , the brits do n't make up for this by murdering 57x as many people with baseball bats you just ca n't compare this way ! all homicides must be shown , per capita , not just handguns the availability of them in the usa makes them the preferred murder weapon , but ban them , and some other weapon will step in as the favorite as a favorite , sure as lethal , not likely a study of violence in chicago produced this table percentage of reported gun and knife attacks resulting in death weapon deaths as percentage of attacks knives \( 16 , 518 total attacks \) 2 4 guns \( 6 , 350 total attacks \) 12 2 source firearms and violence in american life it might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives if this were so , knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate , and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used \( like vancouver \) would show a higher fatality rate but the nat'l commission on the causes and prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case it appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks \( which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants \) , the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks in fact , the reverse was true what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stabs wounds , wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest , etc most gun homicides did not show this pattern rather , more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim source report on firearms and violence then , since england ! usa \( my ancestors left because of the oppression \) you must compare england before strict gun laws to england after strict gun laws to be able to draw any meaning at all england has essentially legalized drugs , so there are no drug gangs battling for turf , etc , there if you drop out the drug related killings here , the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there are a lot of factors which make a difference actually , i'm not fond of making any kind of social parallels between europeans and americans there are more cultural , beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities i just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks i do n't think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent crime here in the us , whether we banned guns or required every law abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi on the other hand , we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar , namely the canadians in fact , an exhaustive , seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of vancouver , british columbia and seattle , washington cities with roughly the same population , urban economy , geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control in seattle , handguns may be purchased legally for self defense after a 30 day waiting period , a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted in vancouver , self defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun concealed weapons are not permitted recreational uses of handguns \( target shooting , collecting \) are regulated by the province purchase of a handgun requires a restricted weapons permit a permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box in short , gun control but not unreasonably so both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws convictions for gun related offenses carry similar penalties the researchers studied all cases of robbery , assault \( simple and aggravated \) , burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from 1 1 80 to 12 31 86 in defining the cases , they used the same standard the fbi 's unified crime report results during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver \( 1 09 1 11 \) burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates \( 99 \) 18 , 925 assaults were recorded in seattle versus 12 , 034 in vancouver the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver \( 1 18 1 15 \) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher \( 1 16 1 12 \) however , when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault , a clear pattern emerged although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons , firearms were far more likely to be used in seattle in fact , 7 7 times as often over the seven year study , 388 homicides occurred in seattle \( 11 3 per 100 , 000 \) vs 204 homicides in vancouver \( 6 9 per 100 , 000 \) after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations , the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle , as compared to vancouver , was found to be 1 63 when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death , the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons \( excluding firearms \) in seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms handguns accounted for roughly 85 of homicides involving firearms handguns were 4 8 times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than in vancouver the authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides \( self defense \) only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven year study , 11 of which were committed by police only 21 cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred 17 in seattle and 4 in vancouver only 13 involved firearms after excluding these cases , there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings this is , i feel , a very fair report one might even make the argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of ottawa , calgary and toronto while seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of nyc , chicago , los angeles and houston critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means this report shows differently if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons , we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in vancouver than in seattle however , during the study interval , vancouver 's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in seattle , suggesting that few would be assailants switched to homicide by other methods as well , ready access to handguns for self defense by law abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report although seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense , these cases accounted for less than 4 of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period and , as was reported , seattle apparently did n't enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self defense heavily quoted source handgun regulation , crime , assaults , and homicide a tale of two cities john h sloan ,

7	i have a '71 buick skylark with 148k on it i bought it in california , and if it 'll let me , i 'd like to keep it for another year the only problem is these indiana winters my heater controls do n't work the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents right now it is stuck in the vent mode it will blow warm air , but i ca n't switch the air flow to either the floor \( i can live without this \) or the defrost \( i ca n't live without this \) i probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position , but this blows a lot of air in my face and is , well , kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think the problem \( or part of it \) is with the two diaphragms which control up down and outside inside air flow the diaphragm which controls outside \( vent \) in side \( no vent \) air is cracked most of the way around , and the other one is probably damaged too , considering the advanced age of the car two questions 1 \) is there anything i should be aware of about this \( other than the fact that i should move from indiana \) \? 2 \) in the event that replacement diaphragms are n't available , is there a way to fix this \? thanks for any advice info selah ,
1	this algorithm works well for me algorithm to attempt to find outward facing normals first , mark all faces as unknown then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge \( where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices \) pick an arbitrary face and mark it counter clockwise using the edge dictionary , orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face and recurse for all surrounding faces , consistently orienting the entire surface find the average of the vertices in this surface using that point , calculate a volume measurement , taking into account the face 's orientation if the volume turns out to be positive , assume the faces are oriented correctly if it is negative , reverse their orientations \( mark them clockwise \) if any faces are still unknown after this , choose another face and go through the algorithm again at the end , faces marked clockwise must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found \( note if you are running on silicon graphics machines and buy the iris inventor 3d toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm see usr src inventor tools ivnorm if you 're not sorry , i ca n't give out the source , and even if i could it relies heavily on inventor \)
11	the willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the usa , and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size the structure of the us government does try to combat this tendency to some extent , but fighting entropy is always a losing battle most people would rather have comfort than freedom the paradox is that you ca n't really have the former , in the long term , unless you have the latter one of the reasons that i probably come across to some people as a weird cross between a libertarian and an establishment tool is that i end up taking an utterly pragmatic view of government i do n't get up in arms when the government fails to protect the interests of the people , because in my lifetime it never has therefore , i have no expectation that it will as a result , i protect my own interests rather than expecting the government to be fair i will use strong cryptography when i think it is needed , whether or not it is legal at the time same thing with anything else the government would rather not see in private hands that 's their problem what 's important to me is using the right tool for the job if it 's legal , so much the better if it is not , but does not violate my \( very strong \) sense of personal ethics , i will use it anyway as long i think it is worth it expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its citizens , except by accident , is utter folly even jefferson , one of the major architects of the american system of government , figured that in a couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self serving that it would be time dismantle it and try again , by revolution if necessary i agree , and while i do n't go around trying to spark one , i 'll certainly participate if it happens when i'm around there is a reason i am such a strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics i 've already written off politics and yes , this may get me in trouble some day if so , so be it i drive faster than 55 mph , too
9	yes but this is irrelevant you 're talking about averages , when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say we know that very , very few people are more than 7 feet tall , so chances are that manute bol is really only 6 foot 4 why is n't lopez likely to hit that well \? he hit that well last year \( after adjusting his stats for park and league and such \) he hit better \( on an absolute scale \) than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment \( and i do n't believe there is \) , then would n't you rather waste lopez 's 22 year old good season than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellent season \? the sooner you get him acclimated , the more of his prime you get to use the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample , but rather that he had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him down until he gets warmed up most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez \? see above but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players are n't that good , so they probably wo n't be that good this year either and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars , not stars , not even good players maybe average , if we 're being charitable ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat , but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent \( not excellent \) and has rotten obp or slg \( depending on who 's in \) blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop wanna bet \? the difference between lopez 's bat and olson berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play , i 'll take the latter every time just like keith mitchell did \? that was me , and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really do n't understand how good lopez is , or overvalue experience , or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization well argued but inflammatory reply deleted
16	here 's a question if most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical , why would we expect it to be imported \? yet it was done done quite successfully for a number of years somebody thought it was worth the risk your assumption is that this low dollar pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun running unprofitable on what do you base this \? and given that smuggling channels are already established , and given the economies of scale , would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms , especially considering doing so would be less hazardous \( in terms of getting caught \) than drugs \? now that was a jump in any case , define local it 's a big country wow , you gotta love the speculation as i posted before , we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the mexican border not only that but ships come in and out of u s harbors every day full stuff and customs does n't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out i 'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore , and you 're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs , because they 'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through it 's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth , but how much more money are they worth than other goods , based on the likelihood of being caught less money than drugs , but also a safer thing to smuggle

0	for several years i 've periodically asked charley wingate to explain this mythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiastically when he pops up every few months his reluctance to explain indicates to me that it 's not so hot i 've said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you might have caught on by now and there is no alternative , but the point is , rationality is n't an alternative either the problems of metaphysical and religious knowledge are unsolvable or i should say , humans cannot solve them if there is truly no alternative , then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim the usual line here , which you call a prejudgment of atheism , and dispute , is that reason is all we have here you admit that you have no alternative , no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge , except possibly that reason conflicts with religious knowledge this sounds very much like i ca n't provide a rational defense for my belief , but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false i hope it makes you happy , but your repeated and unfounded assertions to this effect do n't advance your cause

15	i am not so sure of jewish proselytism then , but i would like to relate an account of a recent dinner i had with jews a few months ago the dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess , whom i had met while visiting my wife in galveston last october the dear old aunt \( now deceased \) was very proud of her jewish heritage , although not especially devout her parents were both murdered in nazi concentration camps in austria during wwii because they were jewish while conversing with her about politics , world affairs and religion , she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to atlanta within two days of returning to atlanta , her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband i went , not knowing really what to expect , other than stimulating conversation and fellowship what i got , however , was rather unexpected the thrust of the evening 's discussion was to condemn the reagan bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics , prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in puerto rico , on the ban on fetal tissue research , and against the mexico city policy , which denies u s foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion the crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of overpopulation , rampant domestic crime , african starvation , unwed mothers , etc , on christianity , rather on the fall of adam now , this is not what i had to come to talk about but every time i tried to bring up the subject of judaism , they would condemn jews for jesus and admonish me against converting to judaism , because it involves too much study and effort and i did not even raise the prospect , nor try to convert them to the truth of christ ! there was certainly no jewish proselytism going on there and again , last november i toured a traditional jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30 minute harangue against jesus and christianity in general i realize that these are two isolated incidents , and that the best supervisor i ever had at work is jewish , but from my experience , the modern jew is not known for his proselytism boundary

13	i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production \( toxic , kidney stone formation \? \) i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i'm going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b6 supplements read on to find out why \( i have my asbestos suit on now guys \) vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed \( above 6 grams per day \) 1 review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev 5 \( 3 \) 110 129 \( 1985 \) but glycine also forms oxalic acid \( d amino acid oxidases \) for both glycine and vitamin c , one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine , but to increase your intake of vitamin b6 2 control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol 20 \( 4 \) 353 59 \( 1988 \) 200 to 500 mg of b6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program 3 the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci 38 277 86 \( 1970 \) patients receiving at least 150mg b6 each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine , this effect is due to increased transaminase activity \( b6 is required for transaminase activity \) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination \( d amino acid oxidases \) for vitamin c , the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40 of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day , not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c \( above 10 grams per day \) , more of the extra vitamin c \( more than 40 conversion \) can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production \( proc soc exp biol med 85 190 92 \( 1954 \) , intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day until 8 grams per day was reached , the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day \( 2 gram dose , 4 gram dose , 8 gram dose and 9gram dose \) 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation b6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b6 that we do n't know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b6 differences in b6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge \( this is not the preferred route of catabolism \) increasing your intake of b6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b6 , some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b6 deficiency \( especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut \) diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate \( urol int 35 309 15 , 1980 \) if 400mg was present each day , there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods 1 beans , coca , instant coffee , parsley , rhubarb , spinach and tea contain at least 25mg 100grams 2 beet tops , carrots , celery , chocolate , cumber , grapefruit , kale , peanuts , pepper , sweet potatoe contain 10 to 25 mg 100grams if the threshold is 130mg per day , you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b6 , you should n't have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b6 is 2mg per day for males and 1 6mg per day for females \( directly related to protein intake \) b6 can be toxic \( nerve damage \) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid \( weeks to months \) the usda food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1 87 mg per day for males and 1 16mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet \( which greatly increases the b6 requirement \) , as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block b6 absorption , are metabolic antagonists of b6 , or promote b6 excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills , alcohol , isoniazid , penicillamine , and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b6 requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10 15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b6 requirement \( this would be on top of your dietary intake of b6 \) any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b6 supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is 2 1 magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate 4 the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate

or are they simply propogranda \? we ca n't know what phill really means because he 's obviously using arguments designed to convince if they 're true or false , regardles of why they were said , why on earth did you make a point of calling them propogranda \? that would seem to be irrelevent oh , i have no argument with questioning them i do n't believe they no longer apply , but that 's because i think most of them were good arguments i'm not entirely happy about the situation , because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time , but i do n't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them since the u s constitution is the basis for the u s political system , most changes in it would require constitutional change in this particular case , however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition it only should have been made part of the constitution \) in principle no \? that they had less power of that they should have had less power \? phill , we 're discusing the power of legislative houses while the prime minister is member of parliament , he is more analgous \( although badly \) to the u s president now , please explain to me how the u s house of representatives is in principle more powerful than the house of lords \( or the senate \) but in practice is less are you suggesting that the writers of the constitution really intended for them to be more powerful , but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they 'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the senate in \? not at all as any entry level political science course will tell you , people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to attack which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want with national interest groups it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a law rather than the states less people to persuade , and less contributions to make why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the federal level \? simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension the same extends to insurance , medicine , and most other questions local government has not failed in that it has n't done what it should , but that it is dominated by local interests thus non local interests who want localities to abide by their rules ca n't get their rules past the local government thus , since they 've got more clout , only in the wrong place , they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower i mean , let 's get real here do we really need the congres of the united states deciding that x traffice light should be on thus and such pattern \? or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime \? the more people want the more congress will take power to sell it to them for their votes i do n't think the rise of special interests is coincidence with the increased power of congress bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters , because political power can be concentrated at higher levels , while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness then why not simply leave new york 's education to new york \? i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that 's what they want to do and if you leave it to them , you only have to worry about the pork in that state and since industries ca n't concentrate their political power and wealth , rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want , individual voices have more relative impact the problem with the fillibuster is not that you must buy off states , but that the congress has acquired too much power to sell pork but why on earth should we want to redirect it \? you said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through congress if congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction , the pork problem is significantly reduced the current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action , thus it the system is weighted against action considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force , i consider bias against making those decisions a good thing the difference with the lower pyramid is that a \) they have more legal , legitimate authority in most matters under our constitution than the federal government , and b \) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate and c \) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once you get to see them tried out without a national decision congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole , yet even with similar problems in different areas , different solutions may be called for and while i often do n't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make , at least i have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off i 'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituents i'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt phill , you brought up the federalist papers we were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senators should be allowed to hold up a bill you claimed the senate was suppose to be a far less powerful house , and i contended there was nothing in the constitution or other writings which indicated this which was when you brought up that we ca n't decide what the founders wanted based on the federalist papers you argued against them , i never argued from them i have primarily referred to the constitution , which places only very small restrictions on the senate than for the house the u s constitution is a nuts and bolts document the delcaration of independence was the high brow reasoning \( there are a couple of other examples , though , such as the reasoning for the power to tax , and the reasoning for the power to grant permits , both in article i , section 8 \) to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it was n't intended however , i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we should n't be worrying about the veto , which is fine , but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse bush \? phill , that 's absurd bush had 37 vetos , one of which was over ridden go read up on fdr if you think that 's anything resembling a record why not \? what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action \? historically governemnt action in the u s when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful when you 're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people , why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority now we 're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill i do n't see how it make a difference sure it 's arguable theyr'e arguing it however , requiring 60 to bring it to a vote ensures that they 'll have to have a good argument something that is n't based solely on party lines no , i am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for action since u s history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece meal on minorities , i feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about and 41 is hardly a tiny minority i do n't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but i see no problem with biasing the federal system against action

15	you ask where we are i would echo that question i'm not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority , what authority do you rely upon for your decisions \? what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time \? this is especially true , since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition , and also over authority and discipline my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope \? \( assuming that the pope 's position does not change and that the leaders of sspx do n't jointly make such choice \) if not , this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if i adopt the view that i'm not wrong , i ca n't be wrong , and there 's no way i 'll change my mind , you must change yours , that i 've either left the catholic church or it has left me the orthodox church does not recognize papal authority jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop , and in ecumenical councils we regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church without going into the merits of the great schism , at least the orthodox agree that a split occurred , and do n't paly what appear to be semantic games like he 's the pope , but we do n't recognize that what he does is effective words aside , it appears to be a de facto split we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over 900 years i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term ` i may be wrong here , i'm not roman catholic \) what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation \? would it be honored \? if not , how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility \? again , i'm not trying to be contentions , i'm trying to understand since i'm orthodox , i 've got no real vested interest in the outcome , one way or the other it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope 's commands as legitimate why \? this is a very slippery slope true enough one could argue that they are establishing a non geographic jurisdiction i do n't know if that 's even a concept or problem in catholic circles larry overacker \( llo shell com \)

10	i finally got it back , with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it 2 rob zettler season 4th acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade c c zettler gave the sharks every bit he 's got this year unfortunately , this still was n't enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler , if that he works hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times , while being basically an offensive zero \( 0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games \) he would be hardpressed to make the team next year 3 david williams season 2nd acquired '91 92 , free agent from new jersey grade c c imo , williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in '91 92 , playing a combination of good offense \( 3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games \) and good defense but he , playing the first part of this season in kansas city , was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it , then , appears that '91 92 was a fluke although he improved towards the end of the season , he was prone to being out of position defensively , and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team 's leading scorer among defensemen last year he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year 4 jayson more season 2nd acquired '91 92 , from montreal in expansion draft grade b after being touted as the team 's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91 92 , more had a rather disappointing '91 92 , as he was not particularly good defensively , and had just 17 points in 46 games he , then , proceeded to improve his game massively this season , becoming the team 's most reliable defenseman , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional \( but only occasional \) offensive flash offensively , he was even more disappointing than last year \( 11 points in 73 games \) , but his defense improved tremendously he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman 5 neil wilkinson season 4th acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b wilkinson was probably the team 's top defensive defenseman in '91 92 however , partially because of injuries , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries , and seemed to be slowed even when playing he , then , had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is , if they are there at all but he also had some solid games , and if he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force 6 sandis ozolinsh season 1st acquired '91 92 , 2nd round pick in entry draft grade i \( a \) at the time of his injury \( december 30 , against the philadelphia flyers \) , ozolinsh was well on track to be , imo , the team 's mvp a serious knee injury in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the season \( 47 games \) , but he still finished as the team 's top scorer among defensemen \( 23 points \) , which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen , but it also tells of ozolinsh 's abilities at the time , he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to so called rookie mistakes , but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team , rookie or veteran if he can come back from his injuries , he is ready to be a star 19 doug zmolek season 1st acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b zmolek had basically a solid and durable year , being one of the only two sharks to play in all 84 games of the season he was solid on defense , but after being billed as an offensive defenseman , he did n't show it \( 15 points \) he was also prone to penalties , and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team however , that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically but to become a fixture in this league , he needs to improve both offensively and defensively , and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents

11	i am sure you did n't miss the implication that we could have another richard nixon type president in the future \( perhaps not too distant future , acutally \) with that in mind , then i take it you also would not object to the gov coming up with a decision \( not proposal just like clinton cripple is a decision , not a proposal \) sprung on us to start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house , which could be activated without your knowlege they would be well concealed so you would n't know the location , to prevent you from covering the lens opening after all , nothing you 're doing would be of the slightest interest to a government official , right \? so , you surely should not object to such a proposal not the best anology , but the principle is pretty close the ability to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort , without your knowlege , protected by entirely by government safeguards you can still draw your curtains , so you can still have your privacy from everyone else \( except big brother \) ! ! after all we need this for protection from drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals \( like 'enemies of the state' \) and you do n't really have a right to unbreakable privacy anyway , sort of as the press release of the clinton cripple decision puts it i find it curious they use the word unbreakable when the term really should be difficult to break without proper authorization \( which the government most certainly has at their disposal , right \? they would n't want to be able to break it illegally , would they \? \) nawww , not for the people clinton can you , while my mind is on it , give us one good reason that the algorithm should be a secret algorithm , unless this encryption scheme either is a joke , or contains features like a 'master key' or other back door for unauthorized eavesdropping \? if it was really even moderately secure , and the government really meant to require the proper court order and the keys that are in the escrow accounts to be able to decipher the traffic , what is the need to keep the algorithm secret \? seems i hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm to remain a secret to be effective , it is not a worthwhile scheme is this just idle talk , or is the administration bullshitting everyone \? with great skepticism , and many doubts on our administrations intentions and wait ! ! we have n't been told the next gem the administration has in mind for e mail and datafile security the press release does say that this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged citizens perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term 'citizens' somehow does not seem appropriate that implies a free people , 'subjects' better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers one thing for certain the government no longer regards the citizens as their bosses anymore , but the other way around

18	the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april 14 , 1993 remarks by the president at summer jobs conference hyatt regency crystal city , virginia 11 22 a m edt the president thank you very much the speech that octavius gave says more than anything i will be able to say today about why it 's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn , to merge the nature of learning and work why it 's important to honor the efforts of people like jerry levin and nancye combs and pat irving and all of those who are here i want to thank the secretaries of labor and education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this and my good friend , governor wilder , for being here and for speaking and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around america who are here this has been a pretty fun day \( laughter \) i loved hearing the young people sing it was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about \( applause \) a year and a half ago i began the quest to seek the presidency because i was concerned about their future because i believe that our country , which had always been a beacon of hope for the young , had too little opportunity , was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways , without a vision to take us into the future i entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people but in the process we might recreate the best of america 's community , knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future all of you here today are committed to that the 1 , 000 jobs that jerry levin has committed time warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here , and those who are around the country the work that nancye combs does , and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage , and especially the eloquent statement octavius jeffers all those things show that together we know what we need to do , and we 're on the right track last july when i was traveling across america 's heartland in my luxurious bus , i visited seneca high school in louisville , kentucky and there i met young people and business people who were participating in the louisville education and employment partnership i saw what nancye combs talked about today i saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work i saw , as i have seen many times in my own state , the principle illustrated that octavius has talked about that for millions of american young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning in the world in which we are living , the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime we must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better and we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today whether you 're in business or in government or in education , you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really , honestly includes opportunity for all of our people there are still a lot of people who say , well , things are pretty good here in washington and everything 's fine the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing they all have jobs \( laughter \) all the people who say that \( applause \) they all have health insurance they all have a pretty good education and they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they 'll be okay no matter what happens i say that not to be either political or unduly critical , but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation everyone is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people , and then find work for them to do all the european countries have higher unemployment rates than we do , but also stronger support systems for the unemployed the japanese unemployment rate has been going up they 're going to adopt a stimulus that , even if you count it in its most rigorous terms , is three or four times bigger than the one that i have proposed to create jobs in west germany alone , the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours this is a big problem for advanced nations it costs a lot of money to add an extra employee , with a lot of pressure from low wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people but it is especially important for america for two reasons one is , we have a whole lot of folks who , unless we move aggressively , will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this the second is , even if we educate them all , if there are n't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors people need to be able to work in this country \( applause \) we have always had some unemployment and , indeed , some of it is normal you 've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another we have now , at this moment in our history , the necessity for all big organizations , including the government , to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs but in the whole , we must still be able to create jobs in a country like america , to provide people with the chance to work it 's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that i will make to congress in the next couple of months it 's going to be hard for me to make those work if , at the end of all this work , to get off welfare there is n't a job \( applause \) so we have two tasks one is to develop the capacity of the american people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth the other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck it is a great challenge i do not pretend that all of the answers are simple but i know if you want to ask the american people , all of them , to be more responsible , if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region , you have got to have opportunity in that mix a part of our vision for america has to be a future for every young person in this country who 's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow there has to be something at the end of that rainbow and that is what we are basically here to talk about today what can we all do as partners , recognizing none of us can do it alone , to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background and then , what can we do to make sure that there 's something there for them to do \? the summer jobs program we 're discussing today is an integral part of that plan , because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness , community it will put the people first , and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector i said when i addressed the united states congress in february on this program that i would seek to create about 700 , 000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the american business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before many , many people have responded to that challenge and jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience and it is terribly important i want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the american people from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills to improving the transition from school to work for young people who do n't go to college but do need at least two years of post high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting , so that they can be competitive workers , making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go all these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan it 's also important , as i said , that we create more jobs the emergency jobs program that i asked the congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half , and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent it would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created it also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass roots level projects long delayed , water projects , sewer projects , park projects , new industries and particularly in small and medium size communities a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment the summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time , through the work of the labor department and the education department and through reaching out to people like you , to make this more than just a one shot summer jobs program to integrate it with private sector efforts to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities and to have a strong , meaningful education component to these summer jobs something that the united states government has never fully emphasized before a lot of these young people , as you well know , because they come from difficult backgrounds , because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances , need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language , reasoning and in other areas and a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year what we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together and then , hopefully , over the next couple of years , if our entire program passes , to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment there will be more applied academics , more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year , so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks , but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience , a whole new work experience , and moving on a pathway to a better future the summer jobs programs are not designed to be make work jobs they 're designed to make a future for the people holding the job and that 's what they will do in the process , they 'll help to build local communities , to strengthen local economies , to solve local problems real jobs renovating housing , repairing public buildings , doing clerical work , providing nursing assistance in hospitals , supervising and training children at child care centers , and learning all the way challenging young people to learn while they earn , but letting them earn you know , it 's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this , that , or the other thing if there 's no evidence of the opportunity that 's at the end of the effort i have not been sparing in going for the last year and a half into places where it is n't exactly popular to say it , and say i wanted to reform the welfare system i wanted to toughen child support i wanted to require people to work i was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets , and i wanted to change all that but if you 're going to summon people to greater responsibility , you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity \( applause \) the young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills , such as math , reading , writing either on the job in the classroom they will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat they will have a sense of accomplishment it will literally be a summer challenge , but a challenge that will take them into a different life so i want to ask all of you to support this effort even as i , as your president , support your effort at the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate we 'll see whether they , instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do , they stayed even or moved ahead i suspect that they will this summer , secretary reich and secretary riley and i will be visiting many of your communities we 'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working , what we should do next summer , how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year , how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well we want to honor the companies and the communities , the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer and , again , i want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort , i thank you and to all of you who have n't , and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today , i want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer i'm telling you , we cannot go through another 10 years when we do n't give these children anything to say yes to if we exhort them to do right , we 've got to be able to reward them \( applause \) when the other speakers were talking , i was sitting up here on the platform , listening and reveling and they got talking about work , and i got to thinking about all the different things i 've done to make a living in my life when i was 13 , i made a very foolish short term business investment i set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books made more money than i had ever had in my life but if i had saved those trunks , they 'd be worth 100 , 000 today \( laughter \) that does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial it just means that you ca n't foresee a generation ahead i have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership and i 've done a lot of different things for a living some people say i got into politics to escape work \( laughter \) i learned something from every job i ever had but i grew up in a generation where i literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who did n't have a job i grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is , get an education and you 'll be all right you 'll get a job and you 'll make more money next year than you did this year now i live in a generation full of people , most of whom do n't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they 're working longer hours and they 're paying more for the basics of life and we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want now , i want to close by reemphasizing these two things it does n't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues , or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector , if young americans do n't get a good education , do n't learn how to work and ca n't be productive , those jobs will not be created in this country machines will do the work or the work will be done off shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages so nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of america 's work force and anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding on the other hand , we need to be honest every wealthy country in the world , including the united states , is having difficulty creating jobs if i knew everything that needs to be done i 'd be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberations of congress and everything else i do n't have all the answers but i know this doing nothing is not the answer \( applause \) and so the jobs program that i have presented to congress , with the summer jobs , with the money for the cities and the counties , through the community development program , with the infrastructure money , is a small part of a big budget it is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not , with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit , we can give a little boost to it , give opportunities to young people , create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector , not government jobs , even though it 's government money and the lion 's share of the work in rebuilding the american economy obviously will come from the private sector that 's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well but this is the challenge we have so i ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program , to ask your friends and neighbors to support it , to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700 , 000 jobs that the united states government should create this summer , so that together we can have this partnership because more than anything else , we have to give a future a future that our young people can believe in we need to send them a message that here in america if you study hard and work hard , if you obey the law and contribute something to your community , you will be rewarded by your country you can build a future from you own dreams that has always been the promise of america together that 's what this summer of challenge needs to be a reaffirmation of the promise of america for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion we can make it a reality thank you very much \( applause \)

11	ok , i should have read the thread before posting my own 0 02 i would just add to phil 's very infomative discussion the following caveat the fifth amendment applies only in crinial cases \( nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself \) thus if the father sued for custody of the children , the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection oddly enough , her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges \( thus landing her in jail \) the interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial , the woman can plead the fifth as to the location of the child this is routine a computer crime prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense , where a suit by a party injured by hackers would not if i am accused , for example , of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should protect my key if i am accused of sending copyrighted material , however , it proabably will not \( copyright infringement not being a crime in the technical sense \) the really tricky question is , say i do both \( naughty boy that i am \) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial \( ie my key \) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution the answer should certainly be no , but lord only knows how this would work out steve

9	not necessarily it could mean that , or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road \( see frank thomas' home road splits in '91 for an example \) i would guess that some of alomar 's split is due to the skydome , but most of it is probably due just to coincidence there 's no way to be sure , of course , but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters , and alomar is not a home run hitter only because of t p 's bogus fielding stats , which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league on a career basis , i think t p 's fielding stats may mean something , but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is , but he sure is n't the worst in baseball offensively , t p rate alomar much higher last year regarding the a vs b argument , i 'll just say they 're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future

17	i would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until i express an opinion before deciding i should be flamed for it as for 'war' i am not sure how i would define it if you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started would you count the riots in the 20 's and 30 's \? violence but not war i personally think that 'war' , as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever , requires organisation , planning and some measure of regualr or semi regular forces perhaps the arab liberation army counts i could easily be convinced it was so from what i know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation the haganah and palmach certainly did that is not a cause for criticism , it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'zionist' camp now you are being silly are n't you \? in any case the war did not start with the invasion of the arab armies you see we both agree on something and the previous posters were wrong , no \? again i am not sure , i doubt you want my opinion anyway , but i think war requires organisation as i said before it needs a group to command and plan if fatah lauches rockets from southern lebanon \( and are you sure you have the right group not the moslems again \? \) then that sounds like war to me stone throwing does not joseph askew

11	i understand , believe it or not , and there are any number of kinds of conversation and communication i engage in that i would n't even consider using this scheme for on the other hand , i do n't see clipper as providing a secure channel it just prevents casual eavesdropping this is part of why i am not worried about it per se trying to look at clipper as a serious security tool is simply ludicrous it 's a voice scrambler , nothing more there is still plenty of market for real crypto they cost an arm and a leg , though clipper is obviously aimed at the mass market it certainly wo n't put cylink out of business this is old news i can do this now there are restrictions example we 're a networking software vendor with a large overseas share of our market we cannot currently ship pem , or even simple des , in our products without case by case approval from the department of state itar presents a material trade barrier to us firms trying to compete in international information systems markets sure , you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over bbs 's in the usa i , on the other hand , want strong crypto \( pkcs , for example \) to be the default for electronic mail , worldwide i want priests to be able to hear confession over email i want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in confidence over email , or doctors talk with patients i want to be able to order products from my favorite japanese mail order catalog over the net i want to be able to sign contracts , transact business , and so on electronically this is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on crytographic systems , especially beyond the borders of the usa clipper is irrelevant , and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe , all the better its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put more restrictions into place , on the theory that it is good enough for anyone who has nothing to hide that argument is , of course , utter bs , just as much as no one needs an assault rifle

4	or there okay , i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware \( im 3 \) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware basically , you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbase 0x170 this was because of how the mac 128 \( and some later machines \) generated sound was by scanning this block and d aing every even byte \( the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines \) when the mac ii \( and apple sound chip \) was invented , it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore , people who port from the ibm do n't want to learn more apis so , it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound , since it is very easy since the mac ii , apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware , and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware , \( mac ii , iix , iicx , iici at least \) , writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs \( quadra 700 900 950 at least \) writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification , but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons if developers use the sound manager \( and i think the sound driver \) , mono sounds will \( typically \) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only , but no one does if developers write to sound base , their games will only come out the left on some games the other problem , the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker , while the se 30 mixes both , is n't really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono , will play on the internal speaker , no matter what machine you have now , to more directly address the question , the games you list and also hellcats , super tetris oxyd \( and many more , these are just what i 've tested \) cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras other games you list and also pga tour golf civilization \( and more , these are again only from personal experience \) use the sound manager and work fine on all machines the more of the story is to developers do n't cheat ! really , i am absolutely , positively not allowed to do what i am about to do , but i'm going say it anyway stop cheating on sound ! really soon , you will be sorry , as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now , and works pretty well and will work even better soon , so use it in conclusion to doug , it is n't a hardware problem , at least , not a bug to jon , it is n't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way , it is taken care of automatically if you cheat , there is not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number 1 i do n't work on sound here at apple , i'm just pretty well informed so do n't write me with sound questions disclaimer number 2 if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed , since i am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that you know what i mean disclaimer number 3 i do n't speak for apple , just me

17	the lengthy article you quote does n't imply this it only states that it is somehow possible , not that it is in any way likely this is akin to an article saying that it is possible that the usaf has several captured ufos , without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion in other words , they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have the us maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft by refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships , us warships have , i believe , become unwelcome in new zealand , which has declared itself a nuclear free zone the usaf has never officially admitted to having any ufos , either this is stated as a fact without supporting evidence it would 've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail , lost to the world , as he suggests maybe elvis , or jfk , somebody let 's put it this way if israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them , how has their disappearance been explained \? people have relatives , friends and colleagues , you know israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown \? people who are presumed to be imprisoned \? this whole conspiracy story is n't something that we 've come to associate with yigal arens before perhaps from now on , we should
0	no , you do n't understand i said that i do n't think people can discuss the subjective merits of religion objectively this should be obvious people here have said that everyone would be better off without religion , but this almost certainly is n't true but , guns and axes are tools , both of which have been used for murder should both be taken away \? that is to say , i do n't think motto misuse warrants its removal at least not in this case
18	to answer your irrelevant question , yes a person of color is human , but i still do n't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding by trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion , you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever the same parallel question could be is a polydactyl person a human being \? you still have not answered what you mean by human being please do so you wo n't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law , but holds solid whatever the law may rule , provide it for me more irrelevancies as larry margolis pointed out , the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses , but does not follow your version of human being and as he pointed out , brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living , but rather who has died there is a significant difference what i am wondering now is , has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started \? you got answers to your questions when you began baiting me , if you recall , after you had made some ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and , having been corrected , changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance if you really wanted a discussion of substance , why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations , e g it really does n't matter to you if it matters to you , then why not define human being and seek some substance \? you 're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words as others point out , one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival again , your analogy fails not precedence , but possession makes a difference here a woman 's womb is indisputably her own also , i see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being was that due to its inconvenience \? is it \? please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling you simply assert things without any support your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported try this on for size it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb there we now have equal arguments but the idea is illogical for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well the systems are dependent on each other for life i'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so your argument is from fantasy island your comparison is a total failure , as i have demonstrated already , and has no basis in reality , neither legally nor medically and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible , that of coercion or oppression , is ridiculous as i said , you give the analogy too little credit for failure on the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real , rather than a hypothetical , situation , then you fly off into siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version as i said before , decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive and , furthermore , as i have already said , there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman 's womb when the fetus is born , what happens to its claim \? and by what reason do you assert its claim \? you have n't answered the question the situations are not analagous again you avoid the question dependence can be transferred , and it is not as slow as you seem to think yes , and i 'd hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn 's children that he was murdered by a religious , pro life fanatic please do try to stay relevant clever comeback i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake \? why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not , by your standards \? what is different about the two situations \? i see i have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child \( you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can \) , and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake you ca n't have it both ways action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle , but you are wrong about the inaction anyway ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was to have a healthy , live child , a woman does more than hang out , eat as she chooses , plays volleyball like she always did , drinks at parties with her friends , etc she behaves very differently , and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart , but it is far from inactive
0	leonard , i 'll give you an example of this my father recently bought a business , the business price was 150 , 000 pounds and my father approached the people in the community for help , he raised 60 , 000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and muslims he knew , 50 , 000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan , after paying off the muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest , this is an example of a muslim community helping one another , why did they help because of their common identity as muslims in turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community the fact is leonard it does work without a fluffy bunny in sight ! ithat is the beauty of islam mas

11	i perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post , but that 's what i get from posting at 1 am the central point i made is that local state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants , legit escrowed keys , etc , may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level i disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops it would be a strong incentive , as vesselin points out , for more police agencies to go rogue and try to get keys through more efficient q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message \? a they would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place the clear implication is that there are legal authorizations other than a court order just how leaky are these \? \( and who knows what 's in those 7 pages that authorized the nsa \? \) there may well arise a black market of sorts within police agencies , in which keys are traded furthermore , the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught they already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions there are a few laws that i know of , that limit citizens' rights to access police communications \( or use the information they get \) it may be very difficult to prove police misuse the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that you have broken some other law throw in private detectives , who have even fewer policy constitutional restrictions also consider mercenaries who 've retired from intelligence agencies william gibson must be loving it great story material do n't think it 'll happen \? well , consider e g the michigan state police , generally a very professional organization , which for years kept red files on thousands of suspected commies , knowing full well it was not consititutional the standards of evidence were just about zero people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where , say , a us china people 's friendship rally was happening the police went around writing down license plate numbers if you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the meeting place , well , the state police wound up filing you as a subversive \( they were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense i believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well \) even with well meaning cops \( and i'm sure there are many \) , there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards we do n't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers it will all be in the interest of enforcing sensible laws , saving lives , and protecting property compromises will be made by well meaning officers , facing what \( to them \) will be a moral dilemma clipper will make criminals out of cops do we want to do this to our police forces \?

15	and many others mailed me here is a reply to one of the letters seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell ! your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers of course , in your termonology , god could not cease to exist however , that is not what death ever means in the scriptures if you will study the word , you will see that it signifies separation death is separation , not ceastation this is the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity , one member of the godhead was separated from the other two i once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined she was to become my girlfriend for several years however , having been drafted , we were separated by distance to me that was a form of death later , she decided that she could n't wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me was death it was separation from that which had made me whole death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship , not because he chose to send you into outer darkness , but because you chose to go there when i rebelled against my earthly father , he spanked me i found no wisdom in that until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children he was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued on my suicidal course he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh and unloving if god warns of impending danger , that is love if choose to let us do as we please , and then at the end tell us the rules , that would be harsh you have a conscience , no matter how calused or fallen it is , that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear this may give light to the error of your understanding one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life as the scripture say heb 4 15 for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who has been tempted in all things as we are , yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil 2 states that he gave up his godhead attributes when he took upon himself humanity it has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this it was to be my phd thesis the consciousness of christ i have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study , including clh it is my conclussion that as jesus , the 2nd member of the trinity , actually suffered as we do he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do he grew in knowledge he chose not to grasp his omniscience , but chose to be taught it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god but in jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before him , the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is , he was not aware that this event was to take place in time he was living sequential history as you or i maybe some other time we can discuss this , but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not i was once a member of that club the free thinker is a glorious ideal by contrast , of course , you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic , inhibited , reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist , that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the christian , it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as a humanist if there is no faith , there can be no dout there is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else ! the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths , will be the devoted adherent of another in fact , it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms , hence the term a theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember however , they disproved their own argument with every thought , every word , every point of logic that they used every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent that is to say , that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary next time you 're in a room of skeptics , yell out look , your fly is undone ! each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism to stress this is to belabor the obvious , but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in a 3rd way of knowing , one which is based on presuppositions but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved , the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt , and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral in other words , another myth presuppositions my friend it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence of course that is hardly an original statement milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia it was even used in the first highlander movie but again , your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology , not what he has revealed of himself through history , through his prophets , through his word , and lastly , but most of all , thru his son if you are to reject god 's annointed savior , then reject him from a correct understanding of himself

18	two institutions with absolute power cute let 's talk practicality , shall we \? if the monarch tried to do something , what would happen \? but you illustrated the problem very well i am contending that there is no state in the union which does not have ample wealth , if they choose to spend it , to run a perfectly acceptable education system \( i further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient , but is being spent badly \) so , tell me phill were the republicans also responsible for some of the huge increases in social programs \? or were they only responsible for what you do n't like \( i contend it is congress which is to blame democrat and republican alike \) most of our worst areas are still better off than most of europe in any case , we 're talking about education yes , i live in once such area you 're woefully ignorant of the situation at the same time some of tennessee 's school districts are closing down , the governor asked for 7 5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats in almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it i do n't know about the rest of the country , but our education problems stem directly from two problems , neither of which are a lack of money in the state \( btw , tennessee is considered a tax heaven and our economy is one of the strongest in the country i see a correlation \) 1 \) what money we spend goes primarly to administration the average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes , and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue and 2 \) the governor is making a concerted effort to create an education crisis in order to push for his pet income tax some of the most idiotic programs get funded \( like state funds for new art in the county seat \) while schools are closing it 's not a lack of funds it 's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate education is the parental hot button education is always the first to but cut , because it 's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art it spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed they did it anyway the continental congress had its own set of bylaws it was n't quite a government , but a means of making decisions had to be created \( however low george washington 's opinion of them were \) allow me again to speak heresy against the holy democratic orders so what \? the government was built with a very non democratic presidency with fairly broad powers , including the veto yes , and the senate was intended to act as a balance to this too much democracy was intentionally avoided it was considered a good thing to place non democratic blocks to impulsive action so long as congress has something to sell , people will pay for it most congressmen rake in more money than they need no , if the progressives do n't want the reactionaries to move backward , they get the same benefit 41 of the states is a lot of people and historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective , especially since it is usually geographically concentrated when wielding the federal big stick i do n't see why they should n't have to make a better argument than , more people than not , agree i'm not a republican i'm a republican \) and no , i'm neither a democrat nor a democrat now , i 've asked several times , and all you 've done is answer it is n't democratic , which i knew before i said it why should it be democratic \? we do n't have a true direct democracy , and few people advocate one why , then , is this other modification of democracy to bias it against action so much worse \?

15	this is a good point christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the messiah in fact , a number of messiahs were active in the area from the time of the roman conquest to after the fall of masada many of the statements made by the apostles especially their repeated attempts to give jesus a sword \( give him military power \) point to the fact that they did n't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact many of the statements in the bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining this new definition of messiah to the jews who were being preached to

15	note i am cross posting \( actually , emailing \) this to bit listserv catholic while main posting goes to soc religion christian quotations omitted this is in response to a question about the immaculate conception i explained it , but left justification up to our catholic readers clh there is no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the mention of mary 's blessedness full of grace in the annunciation by angel gabriel in luke 1 26 28 and in the 6th month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee , named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph , of the house of david and the virgin 's name was mary and the angel came unto her and said , hail , thou that art highly favoured , the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now , now , hold that line of thought the lord is with mary blessed art thou among women while you read on in the book , first lady of the world , a popular history of devotion to mary by peter lappin the immaculate conception matter is really far more complicated than the assumption this arose in 430 ad it is quite possible that the feast of mary 's conception under the title the conception of saint anne , originally commemorated the physical miracle of a woman beyond the age of child bearing , conceiving a daughter , just as elizabeth had conceived john the baptist a transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in anne to the miracle of grace wrought by god in the soul of mary was logical mary is the incorruptible timber out of which was hewn the tabernacle of christ 's sinless body she is god 's eden , in whom there is no tree of knowledge , and no serpent that harms her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in christ , her purity in that of the father at the time of the council of ephesus , she was hailed as innocent , without blemish , immaculate , inviolate , spotless , holy in soul and body , who was blessed as a lily from among thorns , unlearned in the evil ways of eve at the end of the thirteenth century , an irish franciscan , john duns scotus \( 1266 1308 \) , god maintained that it was a greater thing for him to preserve his \( the son \) mother from all sin than to use his power to clease her from it later now let 's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin from pocket catholic cathechism by john a hardon baptism concupiscence remains after baptism concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial , it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of christ jesus , manfully resist \( canon 5 \) original gifts of adam and eve before their fall in the light of the foregoing , we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over they had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely the had the preternatural gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity , or the internal power to control desires they had the supernatural gifts of sanctifying grace , the virtues of faith , hope , and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven by their disobedience , they lost the supernatural and preternatural gifts entirely , and were weakened \( without losing \) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely baptism restores the supernatural life lost by adam 's sin it does not restore the preternatural gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day going back to immaculate conception \( i am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle' \) given the miracle of st anne bearing a child at a non childbearing age , and christ was not yet born and there was no baptism yet on mary 's birth but still , the angel gabriel 's greetings was hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with you blessed art thou amongst women even mary was confused about this greeting mary could very well have possessed all of the treefold original gifts above given to our first parents \( adam and eve before their sin \) hail mary \( example of praise given by the angel gabriel \) full of grace \( natural , preternatural , supernatural \) the lord is with you \( at those times , god would definitely want to be with those he has made blessed \) blessed art thou amongst women \( that says it all \) at the conception , god made mary full of grace and blessed as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of christ and so , immaculate conception of mary is true and mary still has maintained her immaculate heart

15	not quite correct biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized col 2 12 buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god , who hath raised him from the dead rom 6 4 therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father , even so we also should walk in newness of life those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism it is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process paul answered your question in romans 9 in v 4 he stated that the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the service of god , and the promises were given to the israelites it is a package deal he goes on to identify those who are true israelites vs 6 8 makes it plain that the true israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of god paul continued to emphasize that he was an israelite in 2 cor 11 22 , then in gal 3 29 he says that all those who belong to christ are abraham 's seed , and heirs to all the promises given to the israelites the promises come with the law it is all or nothing why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law \? certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden \? same law btw please give a reference for your statement that the gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants could you list those please acts 15 deals with circumcision and the law of moses which was added because of transgression of god 's eternal law \( gal 3 19 rom 4 15 \)

last week alastair posted some questions about fighting , and whether there are such things as justifiable wars i have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as i go i have n't answered all his questions yet , and i know what i have here is on a slightly different tack , but possibly i 'll be able to get into it more deeply later , and post some more info soon our duty to our neighbour do good to all men \( gal 6 10 \) love our neighbour as ourselves \( matt 22 39 \) act the part of the good samaritan \( luke 10 \) toward any who may be in trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man , and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm \( even medical corps of the army etc \) christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel \( ephesians 2 11 12 \) , and also recognise that god rules in the kingdoms of men , and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith we are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations , so we are just passing through , and not part of any nation or any national aspirations \( this can also be applied to politics etc , but that 's another story \) we are not supposed to strive or resist evil \( even suffer yourselves to be defrauded \) it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up god 's kingdom our duty to the state render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar 's and unto god the things which be god 's \( luke 20 25 \) let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of god \( rom 13 1 2 \) submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord 's sake whether it be to king as supreme for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men \( 1 pet 2 13 15 \) these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command , but it is equally clear from acts 5 19 29 that when any ordinance of man runs counter to god 's law , we must refuse submission to it the reason for this is that we are god 's bond servants and his service is our life 's task an example of the type of thing is in col 3 22 23 where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the lord so also we should work as if our boss was god i e pressed down , shaken together , and running over oops a bit of a side track there in the contests between the nations , we are on god 's side a side that is not fighting in the battle , but is testifying to the truth when we believe in god and embrace his promises , we become fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god , and are no longer interested in associations of the world think of this in relation to unions etc as well paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that is set before us , and if we are wise , we will discard any association which would retard our progress thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life , that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier \( 2 tim 2 3 4 \) one of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers one of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers , but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about god \( in this case the army \) the principle comes from deut 22 10 remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths , one was clean and one unclean under the law these ideas are strongly stressed in 2 cor 6 13 18 i suggest you read this the yoking also has another aspect that of servitude , and jesus says take my yoke upon you , so we are then yoked with christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers we have already seen that we are bondservants of christ , and paul says become not ye the bondservants of men \( 1 cor 7 23 rv \) an example from the old testament the question is asked in 2 chr 19 2 shouldest thou help the ungodly \? the situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life here are the facts 1 he had made an affinity with ahab , who had sold himself to work wickedness before the lord \( 1 kings 21 25 \) 2 when asked by ahab to form a military alliance , he had agreed and said i am as thou art , my people as thy people \( 1 kings 22 4 \) an unequal yoking 3 he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the lord \( trying to do the right thing \) , he found that he was yoked and therefore could n't break away from the evil association he had made god says to us come out from among them and be ye separate , and touch not the unclean thing , and i will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters \( 2 cor 6 17 \) this is more or less what i have found out so far i'm still looking into it , as i do n't think i 've answered all the questions raised by alastair yet heres a summary and a few things to think about the christian in under command obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with christ \( john 15 10 , 14 \) total dedication to this course of action is required \( romans 12 1 2 \) disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his followers \( 1 pet 2 7 8 \) we are to be separated to god \( rom 6 4 \) this involves a master servant relationship \( rom 6 12 , 16 \) no man can serve two masters \( matt 6 24 , 13 , 14 \) all that is in the 'kosmos' is lust and pride quite opposed to gos \( 1 john 2 16 \) christs kingdom is not of this world \( i e not worldly in nature \) if it was , his servants would fight to deliver him if christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world , then his servants cannot possibly fight for another master strangers and pilgrims have no rights , and we cannot swear allegiance to anyone but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all \( 2 tim 2 24 \) this does not just apply to war , but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives there is a war to be waged , not with man 's weapons \( 2 cor 10 3 4 \) , but with god 's armour \( eph6 13 20 \) i 'll probably post some more when i 've had time to look into things a bit further

5	i have a peculiar color problem with macx , apple 's macintosh x server i 'd like to know if others have seen the same problem it 's happened with the current version \( 1 2 \) , and with version 1 1 7 when some types of client windows are displayed , parts of the windows are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly , forcing the server to repaint it , it is repainted in the correct colors it does n't happen for xterm windows , but has happened for graphic windows and with some motif clients

7	the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce by briefly lifting off , then quickly \( but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown \) applying throttle above 3000 rpms , the convertor will never unlock it would kickdown first who says there 's no skill involved in driving an automatic \? i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot , while having both hands to steer
15	reply to pwhite empros com here in america people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club what i mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process people tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking , off they go to another one i think that scripture presents the idea that god takes a different perspective on the church choosing process it seems to me from 1cor 12 that god does n't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us so , i think a better question is not how do i choose a church but how do i figure out where god is trying to place me if a person was instrumental in leading you to christ , the church they go to is a logical first choice you have been born into the family of god people should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family if you met the lord on your own \( so to speak \) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters here you are more like an orphan prayerfully go and leave yourself on a few doorsteps and see if anyplace feels like home i would n't expect that god want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people , but on the other hand there are no perfect churches if you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them on the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment , you will spread that wherever you go in general , i think that god will try to place you in a church that talks about the lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base

1	i am looking for a package which takes as inputs a set of geometric objects defined by unions of convex polytopes specified in some manner , say by inequalities and equalities , and determines in some reasonable form things like intersections , unions , etc etc does anyone know where i can find such a thing \?
12	i used a bunch as weights , when building a model airplane hung them on the stringers , across the stringer , or whatever worked pretty well
12	bubblejets often splatter a little bit , whereas laserjets \( given half way decent toner , like hp 's microfine stuff \) do n't both produce very good output , but you do n't have to look too closely at the two to tell that laserjet output is definitely superior on the other hand , laserjets which have n't been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output , much worse than a bubblejet \) one other thing there are bubblejets , and then there are bubblejets there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output \( such as hp 's dinky little bubblejet \) , whereas most produce really good looking output \( such as hp 's deskjets \) ibm and canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets joel kolstad
8	mark kromer , on the thu , 15 apr 1993 00 42 46 gmt wibbled does the amount of exhaust allowed to leave the engine through the exhaust pipe make that much of a difference \? the amount of air fuel mixture that a cylender sucks in \( tries to suck in \) depends on the speed of the piston when it goes down and the pressure in the cylinder at the end of the exhaust stroke with a poor exhaust system , this pressure may be above atmospheric with a pipe that scavenges well this may be substantially below atmospheric this effect will vary with rpm depending on the tune of the pipe some pipes combined with large valve overlap can actually reverse the intake flow and blow mixture out of the carb when outside the pipes effective rev range now , my question is which one provides more resistence as far as the engine is conserned \) resistance that the exhaust provides \) or the resistance that results from the bike trying to push itself and the rider two completely different things the state of the pipe determines how much power the motor can make the load of the bike determines how much power the motor needs to make \) v \( ark \) fzr400 pilot zx900 payload rd400 mechanic you 're welcome well i , for one , am so very glad that i have fuel injection ! all those needles and orifices and venturi and pressures it 's worse than school human biology reproduction lessons \( sex \) always made me feel a bit queasy nick \( the simple minded biker \) dod 1069 concise oxford tube rider m'lud

' is he some jew who perhaps lived in israel and just could n't make it there , and is now taking his failure out on israel \?

13	then let me ask you for a workable solution we have a name here that implies certain things to many people rather than trying to educate each and every person that comes to the group is there some name that would imply what this group was originally intended for \? my dad was a lawyer as such i grew up with being a stickler for meaning in my reality , psychoactives technically could range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more standard recreational drugs in practice i had hoped to see it limited to those that were above some psychoactive level like some of the drugs you mention , but also possibly including some recreational drugs but with conversation limited to their psychoactive effects the recent query about bong water , i thought was a bit off topic so i just hit k but back to the original question what is a workable solution what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to discuss \? it sounds like there should be a alt smartdrugs , or something similar i do n't feel psychoactives would generally be used to describe alot of those drugs there is a big difference between a drug that if taken in certain doses , over a period of days may have a psychoactive effect in some people , vs many of the drugs in pihkah which are psychoactive wm

the former ottoman parliamentary representative for erzurum , karekin pastirmaciyan , who assumed the revolutionary name armen garo another former ottoman parliamentarian , hamparsum boyaciyan , led the armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname murad , especially ordering that 'kill turks and kurds wherever you find them and in whatever circumstances you find them turkish children also should be killed as they form a danger to the armenian nation ' \( hamparsum boyadjian 1914 \) 1 1 m varandian , history of the dashnaktsutiun , p 85 another former member of parliament , papazyan , led the armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of van , bitlis and mush in march 1915 , the russian forces began to move toward van immediately , in april 11 , 1915 the armenians of van began a revolt , massacring all the turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by russians little wonder that czar nicholas ii sent a telegram of thanks to the armenian revolutionary committee of van in april 21 , 1915 , thanking it for its services to russia the armenian newspaper gochnak , published in the united states , also proudly reported in may 24 , 1915 that only 1 , 500 turks remained in van the rest having been slaughtered source hovannisian , richard g armenia on the road to independence , 1918 university of california press \( berkeley and los angeles \) , 1967 , p 13 the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over 130 , 000 square miles the estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4 , 700 , 000 , of whom 940 , 000 \( 20 percent \) were armenian , 1 , 200 , 000 \( 25 percent \) georgian , and 2 , 220 , 000 \( 45 percent \) moslem of the latter group , 1 , 140 , 000 were tatars paradoxically , barely one third of transcaucasia 's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia , where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44 , 000 armenians as compared to 68 , 000 moslems by the time of the russian census of 1897 , however , the armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000 inhabitants this impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia \( see also map 1 historic armenia and map 4 administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia \) in 1920 , '0' percent turk we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now , those

closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire leaving erivan on april 28 , 1915 , armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the ottoman empire , and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i , the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman 's enemy increased drastically ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks , armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies source stanford

constitution the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state governed by the rule of law bearing in mind the concepts of public peace , national solidarity and justice respecting human rights loyal to the nationalism of ataturk , and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the preamble of the constitution freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the ottoman empire , allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous the fact that the ottoman empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms , despite the lack of any written constitution the first attempts to create a written constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856 although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily , they provided the basic elements of a constitution the 1876 constitution was the first legal document to force a parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the emperor the constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the emperor , while increasing the power of the parliament and the government the first world war \( 1914 1918 \) brought the

12	i had a similar idea , for a fax answering machine switch , to put both machines on one line you order distinctive ringing from your phone company this is 3 month here you get a second \( unpublished \) phone number when someone calls this number , your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings you set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings you 'd give out the new as your fax a device would measure the length of rings when it detects a short ring , it turns off your answering machine five rings later your fax picks up the call this should be cheaper and more elegant than the 80 switches now available but that 's not what i did i'm giving out the new to my friends and customers this should leave the old for telemarketers , etc i wo n't pick up the phone when i hear the long rings
7	that is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live if you live in a place where crime is apparent , then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent however , if a professional thief wants your vehicle , its as good as gone no matter what you do but to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options that would be 1 \) ignition kill or fuel cut off 2 \) a flashing red led these two are basic to a decent alarm system to slow down the criminal some more , get a steering wheel lock that should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target but , then there 's always car jacking why is life so confusing \? i hope i helped somewhat

13	i do n't know if anyone knows about this topic electrical heart failure one of my friends has had to go to the doctor because he had chest pains the doc said it was arythmia so he had to go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated his doctors said that he could die from it , and the medication caused cancer \( that he was taking \) well , i suggested that he run , excersize and eat more , \( he is very skinny \) but he says that has nothing to do with it does anyone know what causes arythmia and how it can be treated \? thanks
15	i must have missed the postings about waco , david koresh , and the second coming how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing , unless the person claiming to be it is obviously insane \? i'm not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ how could somebody who breaks his word be the second coming \? koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast he did n't still it seems to me that he did fool some people and , from my meagre knowledge of the bible , it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ 's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities did n't accept as the messiah so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the second coming while , at the same time , not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be god mark 13 21 and then if any one says to you , 'look , here is the christ ! ' or 'look , there he is ! ' do not believe it mark 13 22 false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders , to lead astray , if possible , the elect mark 13 23 but take heed i have told you all things beforehand mark 13 24 but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light , mark 13 25 and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken mark 13 26 and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory my understanding of jesus' answer is that , unlike his first coming , which was veiled , the second coming will be quite unmistakeable he 's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming the actual second coming will make his power openly visible by the way , from koresh 's public statement it 's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be christ
15	\? huh \? okay , so i'm not eric molas , but even if that is how he feels about life , i disagree with it life , to me , is definitely not meaningless it has precisely the purpose and meaning i choose to give it i go on living because i like living if i needed any further reason , i 'd be free completely free ! to pick any reason that suited me that freedom can be almost intoxicating it 's probably the closest i 've ever been to a 'religious' experience i'm very glad i am an atheist i would n't be anything else not unless , in explaining your own subjective experience , you also try to convert him or proselytize merely explaining the effects you personally experience religion as having on you , is not infectious not unless eric is paranoid , that is whatever floats your goat you sound happy enough that 's fairly much all that matters , right \? erh pardon , but it strikes me that sentence sounds reversible empty spot \? god shaped hole \? i hear such things a lot from theists never quite did understand what they were talking about i have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole' maybe some others do , i would n't know but i do n't , and if i did , i 'd seek help about it does n't sound like a mentally healthy situation at all , walking around with a 'hole' in oneself well , not having written that original post , i do n't know if it was intended to be interpreted in such a way but , having reread it carefully , i somewhat doubt it at least , that 's not how he gets across to me , your mileage may vary
18	absolutely nothing , seeing as there is no table for heterosexuals if , as you claim , the supposedly higher promescuity amongst homosexual males makes them an insurance risk , you need to be show that heterosexual males are less promiscuous than homosexual males without the data on heterosexual males , we cannot make a comparison between promiscuity rates of heterosexuals and homosexuals mjcugley maths and cs dundee ac uk \( world \) or mjcugley uk ac dund maths and cs \( uk \) well , the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits if the oppertunity presented itself \? i reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a huge variety of willing partners the question here is not of being that , i suppose , says a lot about how screwed up you are clayton e cramer uunet , pyramid ! optilink ! cramer my opinions , all mine ! xavier

16	this was posted to the firearms politics mailing list hi folks thursday , april 15 marked day 3 of the trial this day marked the first testimony of the trial deputy u s marshal larry cooper took the stand for the prosecution the short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution cooper testified that he had arrived in spokane \( washington \) on august 17 , 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the weaver cabin the team was using night vision equipment for surveillance , and split up into two teams of three people the six later met at an observation point above the cabin after this , deputies cooper , william degan , and arthur roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites cooper told the court that roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see , whether the weaver family dogs would respond striker , the weaver 's yellow lab , started toward them barking loudly roderick led the three in a run from the area they ran through some dense woods into an open area called the fern field with the dog in pursuit by this time , kevin harris and samuel weaver had joined the chase the surveillance team had reached a y in the road cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be shot in the back as degan reached the y , he spotted randy weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead weaver was startled but did not fire at this moment , striker reached degan , and cooper had to fend him off with his gun it is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog both cooper and degan then took cover in the woods according to cooper , kevin harris and samuel weaver continued walking down the road , apparently not noticing the two after they had passed by on the road , degan got up on one knee , raised his gun , and shouted , stop ! u s marshal ! harris then brought the weapon around at hip level and fired he did n't bring the weapon up to eye level i saw bill 's arm going back , and i knew he had been hit cooper fired at harris , and harris went down cooper then brought his weapon to bear on samuel , but did not fire at this point , cooper then heard two shots to his right samuel weaver looked in the direction of the shots , yelled , you son of a bitch ! and ran toward them cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead , so he fired a three round burst at the cabin at this point he then saw samuel weaver running toward the cabin when cooper reached degan , he placed his first two fingers on degan carotid artery , counted two or three beats , and then his heart stopped shortly thereafter , roderick and the other three marshals joined him they then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin on cross examination , david nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley , asking , you wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog , did n't you \? nevin also pointed out that in last september 's testimony , cooper had claimed that he spotted weaver after the dog had left him cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that thursday 's account was correct nevin continued the cross examination by asking what cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him no answer was available friday , april 16 marks continued cross examination of cooper notes there was no coverage of protestors drew

11	true in theory in practice \? the technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key , as i understand it to , it could be made effectively impossible to record once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access the telco is n't supposed to give that without a warrant that 's the rule today but even so , the evidence would not be admissible , i think , unless the judge so ordered i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cops ca n't record today 's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge , hey , can we have permission to listen to those tapes \? can they \? yes , that is a major concern , but i think that they think they can win just by having 99 5 of the usa use this system they do n't even have to care about the cautious 5 that 's left they do n't catch the really smart crooks anyway john gotti , who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped , glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans that 's why he 's in jail now hard to believe , but true this scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more , which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they are dropping the so called digital telephony proposal , according to rumours however the meaning of that is complex , since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems , and that requires a bit of work
18	there are a couple of ways to look at them one is , we want you to support this constitution , so we 'll say anything that we think will appeal to you , or the more straightforward , this is why we think what we 've suggested in this constitution is a good idea you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation well , i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist , and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson 's democratic impules but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we do n't consider what they wrote about the government \? and is writing in support of something automatically propoganda to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they do n't believe \? if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords , than we 'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also \( in fact , they both were , because the british government had much greater power than did the american system \) i disagree the system is not too slow , it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle as somebody in washington put it \( whose name i forget \) , congress has become everybody 's city council congress is more than capable of quick action , and has more than enough power and time on its hands , if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy it is not a case of the system of government they created failing , but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid namely , a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheels all you 'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things it would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level please explain to me how bush abused the veto in an extraordinary manner i fail to see where any restrictions , implied or otherwise , were placed on the veto it could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise \( in the executive 's opinion \) policies there is no limit in the constitution to the president 's veto power regarding what a bill is for previous presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons , most usually having something to do with their agenda i am really curious how you single bush out as the president who abused vetos why is it not a reasonable restriction \? because 51 senators is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based \? if 41 senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster is n't that enough to indicate there 's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evaluate it \? why one earth should 51 be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very , very diverse places and living in radically different conditions \? why should n't a super majority be required \? any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored i do not see this as a positive thing and for all that i'm sure the republicans are looking for pork as much as the democrats , they 've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question

terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i'm not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software \( pcw \) that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification \( you can compute an image using selected components \) i 've used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems , but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it , but large images take quite a while \( 50 70 times as long \) to process that 's a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl \( interactive data language \) from research systems , inc idl is in my opinion , much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well , also personally , i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax \( or mathematica , igor , or even excel on the mac if it 's not too hairy \) , then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination could n't handle , and the speed and ease of use \( compared to iraf \) was incredible by the way , it 's mostly astronomical image processing which i 've been doing this means image enhancement , cleaning up bad lines pixels , and some other traditional image processing

host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations \( a unix machine similar to a sun \) though there were rumors \( there are always rumors \) that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci , inc , out of richmond hill , ontario , canada , makes an array of software utilities for processing , manipulation , and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg , bsq , landsat , and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos , unix workstations \( among them hp , sun , and ibm \) , and vms , and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities , grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into , or write those formats out from , the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays , output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer , e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis , equalization , user specified operations \( e g multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and store as channel 5 \) , and god only knows what all else there 's a lot i do n't have and do n't use these , so ca n't say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters , read from a common parameter file which must be \( in vms anyway \) in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic , but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common , complicated , lengthy or difficult series of utility executions \( in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure \) there 's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with \( read from write to \) the pci data structures \( database file , parameter file \) the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images , but requires such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the level where you can handle r s images , you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance , the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band \( what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw \) data from tape , in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry 's ct2t format , would probably \( i have n't tried \) handle targa , and so on above all , however , you have to know what you 're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it 's worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster \( image \) data , but vectors \( for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table \) , land use , and all manner of other information \( i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands , latitude , longitude , time , date , etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database \) i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems \( the name gould deanza seems to come to mind \) one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q \( q bus 24 bit directcolor \) display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users , i e those for whom a mac pc largely does n't suffice \( although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time \) it 's probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada , a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam \( spectral analysis manager \) back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam \( spectral analysis manager \) which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery \( byte data , 256 pixels across by 512 lines by 256 bands \) a modified version has since been developed for aviris \( airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer \) which uses much larger images spam does none of these things \( rectification , classification , pc and ihs transformations , filtering , contrast enhancement , overlays \) actually , it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement \( stretching \) spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar , an executive based on tae , and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you 're interested pcw requires x for display map

17	from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle east by elias davidsson the following proposal is based on the following assumptions 1 fundamental human rights , such as the right to life , to education , to establish a family and have children , to human dignity , the right to free movement , to free expression , etc are more important to human existence that the rights of states 2 in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities , basic human rights should prevail 3 between the collectivities defining themselves as jewish israeli and palestinian arab , however labelled , an unresolved conflict exists 4 this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people it moreover poisons relations between communities , peoples and nations 5 each year , the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties 6 attempts to solve the israeli arab conflict by traditional political means have failed 7 as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical religious communities peoples which claim the land , there is no just nor peaceful solution possible 8 love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice when people love , they share having stated my assumptions , i will now state my proposal 1 a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli jew and the other palestinian arab 2 to be entitled for a grant , a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner , although born in areas under current isreali control , is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return 3 for the first child , the grant will amount to 18 000 for the second the third child , 12 000 for each child for each subsequent child , the grant will amount to 6 000 for each child 4 the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeli arab conflict , including the u s government , jewish and christian organizations in the u s and a great number of governments and international organizations 5 the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in israel palestine , all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide , would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle east in a graceful manner objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced i will attempt to identify some of these 1 the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage , is not conventional however , it is based on the concept of affirmative action , which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation 2 it may be objected that the israeli palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict , but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle this objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not zionism as ideology and practice , but israeli jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights \( see above \) 3 fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages' from their point of view , the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration , be it human love , peace of human rights the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel , a german magazine he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a calamity , comparable in its effects only with the holocaust this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions \( see above \) 4 it may objected that only a few people in israel palestine , would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal , the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes 5 it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes this objection has merits however , it must be remembered that huge sums , more than 3 billion , are expended each year by the united states government and by u s organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middle east through armaments a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in israel palestine , thus encouraging the emergence of a non segregated society in that worn torn land i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment
0	false dichotomy you claimed the killing were not religiously motivated , and i'm saying that 's wrong i'm not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate , as i spelled out in detail does anyone else see the contradiction in this paragraph \? sorry , frank , but what i put in quotes is your own words from your posting 1qi83b ec4 horus ap mchp sni de do n't tell us now that it 's a different claim if you can no longer stand behind your original claim , just say so
0	it 's not the fact that it ca n't exist that bothers me it 's the fact that you do n't seem to be able to define it if i wanted to hear about indefinable things that might in principle exist as long as you do n't think about them too carefully , i could ask a religious person , now could n't i \?

16	ok a near majority actually own firearms , but i will still claim that the vast majority never needs to use them or even threaten anyone with them what do they do right or are they just lucky \? in either case , this means the 'average threat level' in this country is rather low i think you have weapons on the brain i never said that these alternative means of self protection involved any hardware why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' \? it is n't because every person is armed to the teeth it is because of \( 1 \) attitude and \( 2 \) cooperation in the 'good' neighborhoods , the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around 'good' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime watch' to increase this effect , and the relative effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested , the good neighbors step up and say that 's the one officer ! he was robbing mr jones' house in short , the alternative to firepower is gangs or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative replace lead with flesh the flesh makes a better conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a block party oliver north the man is positively worshiped in many all american 'conservative' quarters he and big ron set up a secret government and did all sorts of severely illegal deeds the kind of stuff you and i would be doing twenty to life for , yet he walks free this bs happens all the time in fact , it happens so much that no one really cares anymore 'legitimacy' is a non issue legality is a non issue so long as we get t bones and our mtv , who gives a rats ass \? no i claimed that no one is interested in the statistical aspects of the argument pure emotion , like the abortion issue argue away you ca n't win
0	what i 've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior that is , it does n't take much work to be moral , but it certainly does to be immoral \( in some cases \) also , i 've said that morality is a remnant of evolution our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal kingdom but , this does n't get us anywhere your particular beliefs are irrelevant unless you can share them or discuss them

10	i found this press release from trial lawyers for public justice on another system , and thought it would be of interest on campuses where the administration or the athletics department wants to eliminate the women 's ice hockey team women athletes , tlp win sex discrimination ruling brown university ordered to restore two women 's varsity teams to national desk , sports writer contact lynette labinger , 401 421 9794 , home 401 274 7507 , or ray marcaccio , 401 831 8900 , both of trial lawyers for public justice
15	again i find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither the time nor the proper materials with me \( you would think i would learn my lesson by now but i'm trying to finish writing my thesis and do n't have tons of time anyway \) the basis for our \( the catholic church 's \) belief in the assumption of mary , body and soul , into heaven is that , to put it simply , the apostles and all the early generation christians believed it in fact , throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with mary , and 11 of the 12 were present when she died only thomas was missing when he arrived several days later , he asked to be shown her body , and moved with pity , peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb when they arrived the seal was still unbroken they broke the seal , entered , and the body was missing there was no sign that anyone had entered , forcibly or otherwise , and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left the apostles present all believed that mary was assumed into heaven and the apostles taught this in their preaching \( of course , this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible , but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them \) basicaly , as an apostolic church \( ie founded by the apostles \) , we believe that the teachings of the apostles , whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources , is true , providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed at least in the case of the assumption of mary , the authenticity is quite clear
3	there were an assortment of firmware problems , but that is pretty much expected with any fax modem talking with a different fax or modem which may have also been revised or is new i'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems , so you 'll have to get it from someone else however , i can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the rockwell mpu \( as opposed to the dpu \) for an internal implementation this is because the mpu used speed buffering instead of having a 16550 interface without the 550 interface , the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions \( like in windows \) as far as i know , the speed buffering works ok for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board hope this helps tom

17	andy beyer has claimed that the israeli press is a bit biased but the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the israeli press simply know nothing about many of these events are not even mentioned here i read the israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing , because of your total reliance on western media for your information on israel since i read both american media and israeli media , i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

13	from article 1993apr22 233001 13436 vax oxford ac uk , by krishnas vax oxford ac uk the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat i inject on my legs and gut , and prefer the gut i can stick it in at a 90 degree angle , and barely feel it i'm not fat , just have a little gut my legs however , are muscular , and i have to pinch to get anything , and then i inject at about a 45 degree angle , and it still hurts the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however so if it 's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot , to prevent irritation when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep , wait for it to dry somewhat , or you may get the alcohol in the puncture , and of course , that does n't feel good a way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected a good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot , and spacing the sites out accuartely \( about 1 1 2 apart \) this is from experience , so i hope it 'll help you \( i have diabetes and have to take an injection every morning \) later , david

15	someone sent me this faq by e mail and i post my response here i'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably have n't seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven \( matt 5 19 this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology 1 the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom 4 15 notes that where no law is , there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai \( eden \) , but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai \( ex 16 \) 2 the problem with the first covenant was not the law , but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people , but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery , they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises \( heb 8 6 \) rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts \( heb 8 10 \) 3 including the sabbath in the acts 15 is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts 15 do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law \( ceremonial \) which was added because of transgression \( of the moral law \) \( gal 3 19 \) 4 israel stands for god 's people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma 9 4 says that the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel , which are of israel v 6 then in gal 3 19 he says if ye be christ 's , then are ye abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham 's seed , jews , israelites not physically , for that is not the criterion , but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws \? you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed , sanctified , and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation \( see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study \) i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law , why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment , which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember \? if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding , then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace , do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding , for i am now under grace \? being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom 3 31 di we then make void the law through faith \? god forbid yea , we establish the law wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good \( rom 7 12 \) do you prefer implication to fact \? a careful study of the acts 20 shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service , but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor 16 there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law , not the sabbath day of the moral law why would you prefer to twist and turn , relying on different arguments which conflict with each other , rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods , to violate god 's name , to break the sabbath , to steal , to kill , etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul 's comments on esteeming one day over another \( rom 14 \) is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings , but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information , but nothing aimed at answering this question act 2 26 describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts 13 44 is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it does n't tell us what day christians met in their houses acts 20 7 , despite darius' confusion , is described by acts as occuring on sunday \( i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start , when the biblical text is clear about what was meant \) the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it does n't say they gathered to see paul off , but that when they were gathered for breaking bread , paul talked about his upcoming travel but that 's just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with 1 cor 16 2 it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul 's collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this , or that they did it in their homes , i ca n't disprove it , but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship , and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was
15	i differ with our moderator on this i thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death \( as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer \( 1979 \) puts it \) was that jesus was tempted , but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity , then jesus fully human \( nicea \) would not be subject to sin , but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning , because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most first , the monophysites inherited none of nestorius 's version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second , the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his \( successful \) opponents \( who wrote the conventional history \) claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary , arguing \( i think correctly \) that a human could not be called mother of god i mean , in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway , nestorius 's opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos , that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus , which would require two seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though , because mary simply gave birth to jesus , who preexisted her either divinely , if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined , or both natures intertwined , a la chalcedon second , i am not sure that nestorianism is not a better alternative than the orthodox view after all , i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus 's human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was a seperate nature , capable of being tempted as in gethsemane \( since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted \) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint was from someone who did n't see how we could call jesus fully human , because he did n't sin i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing , he is thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you , and have said elsewhere , that there 's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents , i thought he got the better of them however , most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance , and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic \( as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him \) in rejecting all approaches other than his own as regular usenet readers know , narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong furthermore , he did say some things that i think are problematical he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute also to the logos , in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is , my brother , either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound , because of it , to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood it 's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to some degree a part in being born , growing up , and dying of course it must be understood that there 's a certain indirectness in the logos' participation in these things but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human , or we do n't have an incarnation at all nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms , and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area you say i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus 's human nature was in heaven i do n't think that 's required by orthodox doctrine it 's the divine logos that is eternal

18	secret purpose of falklands war with in visibility technology dr beter audio letter 74 of 80 digitized by jon volkoff , mail address eidetics cerf net audio letter \( r \) is a registered trademark of audio books , inc , a texas corporation , which originally produced this tape recording reproduced under open license granted by audio books , inc this is the dr beter audio letter \( r \) , 1629 k st nw , washington , dc 20006 hello , my friends , this is dr beter today is april 30 , 1982 , and this is my audio letter \( r \) no 74 it 's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic on the surface it seems that it 's only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren , wind swept falkland islands and south georgia island in reality , it 's far more than that the so called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation during this month of april 1982 , fierce naval battles have taken place not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides but as i say these words , the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface beginning today , april 30 , a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area to be effective , a blockade must be imposed over a period of time , but the royal navy does not have that much time winter is coming on in the south atlantic , and the british supply lines are overextended having come this far , her majesty 's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat that reason , my friends , is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses to obtain that cover story , the british have no choice but to sail into combat but in doing so , they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained in short , my friends , her majesty 's navy has sailed into a trap the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange , ironic echoes of the past for weeks now we 've been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an armada \( quote \) the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description the original spanish armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force , but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of england 's queen elizabeth i the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake drake and his small , fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle the english fleet was equipped with new longer range guns , and it stayed upwind and out of reach from there the english pounded , smashed , and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada when it was all over , barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port drake 's defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire today , 400 years later , history seems to have come full circle queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i , and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation once again a so called armada is preparing for invasion , but this time the armada is british , not spanish four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day today , the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain 's naval supremacy , and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy my three special topics for this audio letter are topic 1 the military secret of south georgia island topic 2 the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic 3 the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war topic 1 when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot for a century and a half since 1833 , the islands have been controlled by great britain during that entire time , british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands , which it calls the malvinas , but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states , and they are not much of a prize after 150 years of occupancy , the falklands are home to fewer than 2 , 000 british settlers and a lot of sheep in short , the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over , and yet here we are watching another crisis take place we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato 's doorstep instead , britain is throwing almost everything it 's got at argentina aircraft carriers , cruisers , destroyers , submarines , assault ships you name it luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force the initial 40 ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70 over two thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina watching all this , a lot of people are asking what 's this fight really all about \? the most popular answer suggested in the major media is oil vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands , but that has been known for nearly 10 years in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month , and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island is 800 miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to south georgia , the falklands are an island paradise south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains , treacherous valleys , glaciers , and semi permanent snow most of it is uninhabitable on top of all that , argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists in 1833 the british expelled them and took over the island for that and other historical reasons , argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina , not britain but no such argument is possible for south georgia island it has always been controlled by britain , never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view argentina 's leaders are military men and they think in military terms they were well aware ahead of time that far off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat , as the island was retaken by britain so the question is why did argentina 's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all \? my friends , the answers to all these questions are military , not political or economic south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret it 's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so called falkland crisis is this secret installation , together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years they are not new what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington for the past two months i 've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year 1982 ! ! it is this fast approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so called falklands crisis to erupt now what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here namely , the rockefeller cartel and russia 's new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis they are trying to ruin phase 3 of the project z war plan which i revealed last month that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one as i mentioned last month , the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war having done that , they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused , safe and cozy in government war bunkers ! when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted , the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh , up to date , powerful military force on earth and using that military power , they will become the undisputed rulers of the world that is , they plan to do all this , and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months the rockefeller cartel and russia 's new anti bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks since that time the united states government has been a house divided , torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions but before that , the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers in 1961 the brothers launched a new long range plan for world domination it was a two prong strategy , half visible and half secret , which i first described long ago in audio letter no 28 it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually without repeating all the details , the basic idea was grandiose yet simple by deliberately appearing weak , the rockefeller controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia then the secret weapons , including superweapons , would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961 , the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres both superpowers , the united states and the soviet union , are located well up in the northern hemisphere so are the other full fledged nuclear powers great britain , france , red china , and india by contrast , the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between in other words , it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an all out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern half of our planet , cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator , then it works its way back to the north as warm air a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone , but very little of the air changes places the military conclusion , my friends , is this the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come but if the calculations are right , the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers a quick look at the globe of the world shows why the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter , nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war he accomplished this as so called coordinator of hemispheric defense for then president franklin d roosevelt so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources then there is the african continent there , too , rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa , especially south of the equator all this was thanks to the efforts of john d rockefeller iii , as i detailed in audio letter no 36 looking around the globe , the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand thanks to world war ii , both were wide open to the rockefellers the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war then , as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust , the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war , some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass for example , revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required one based in the south atlantic , the other in the south pacific since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war , they could not be built in existing shipyards new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden to hide an entire shipyard is no small task they take up a lot of space on top of that , it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over all secret installation finally , the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely , the secret navy might be wiped out the combined requirements for secrecy , space , and protection against attack were formidable but one day in 1959 , while all these plans were still in the early stages of development , the answer presented itself during a so called banking trip to sweden , david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger , more secret , better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted a survey of candidate sites was then initiated the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby , making the desired level of secrecy impossible finally , it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected in the south pacific , extreme southern new zealand was selected this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no 71 three months ago when i called attention to new zealand 's extreme importance in the coming war in order to obtain the necessary space , the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water 's edge the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island , which is off the tip of south island the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt anglem the new zealand location met all the requirements ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain the location is far from the equator , and the installations are buried deep under mountains , protected from nuclear attack they are also too deep to be reached by particle beam attacks , and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found that site , my friends , is south georgia island it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic the tall , rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100 mile long island it is controlled by great britain whose government , like that of new zealand , was willing to cooperate and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast the whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built , but britain took no chances in 1965 the whaling station was closed down since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists construction of the secret naval facilities two in new zealand , one on south georgia island began in the early 1960 's the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities , such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain , colorado however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland in this way , the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement , the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up when sealed , the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction projects , there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention the man made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous , but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea once the secret naval facilities were built , they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage the fake disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme he was then secretary of defense robert mcnamara all through the 60 's mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america 's visible military power this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards where it went , my friends , was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island ! the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently , it is cheaper to build two ships at a time that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines they are all nuclear powered nuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers and yes , nuclear aircraft carriers , three of them a secret twin was built for the u s s nimitz , for the u s s eisenhower , and for the newly launched u s s carl vincent all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns , so called , that we constantly hear about in the defense department and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way ! the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear powered vessels even so , the secret naval ships possess one key difference last month i revealed that the so called stealth program has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity a whole new fleet of phantom war planes are now going into crash production that use this principle and , my friends , all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth field equipment ! the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field after nuclear war one , the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago , my friends , but three years ago they lost control of the united states military now it 's the american bolsheviks who are in control , and they are bent on war these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the falklands crisis topic 2 in audio letter \( r \) no 73 last month i described project z , the new bolshevik three phase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war room here in washington it 's a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow , followed by all out thermonuclear war with russia having set off the holocaust , the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate , they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies activating phase 3 of their grand strategy , they plan to unveil their secret weapons , especially their secret naval fleets with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world the united states as we know it will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves , this outcome will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982 ! time is fast running out the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war but , my friends , the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race they have two deadly enemies , both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the new anti bolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways in audio letter no 71 three months ago i reported that a limited , new anti bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians the january 26 meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva , switzerland , was a turning point in the formation of this coalition it is now a reality , and is responsible for the so called falkland crisis now dominating the headlines it should be emphasized that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance they have very major disputes to be settled between them , but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy the bolsheviks here in america the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war if they can do that , time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no 67 a slow down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti bolshevik actions to be implemented the joint rockefeller russian planners decided by mid february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer the exact details of the project z war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or the russians , but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase 3 of the bolshevik war plan that is , the bolshevik controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled by working together , the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone the rockefeller group , who built and originally controlled these bases , provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question there was no combination of commandos , frogmen , or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter in a way , the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles' heel the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible the key lay with argentina and her long standing claims to the falkland islands as i mentioned in topic 1 , the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse , a military cover , to enable the south georgia base to be attacked the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means , but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do as an inducement to cooperate , the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over , the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy and to bolster the troubled argentine economy , it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards , the argentine military junta agreed to the plan on march 19 argentina carried out act 1 in the joint attack plan a group of argentine scrap metal merchants , of all things , landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work site the british , always nervous about south georgia island , promptly reacted as expected the british antarctic survey ship endurance put 22 marines ashore they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering 150 year old falklands dispute to a boil from time to time in the past , argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders , so there was no hint of what was really afoot during late march , argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands nothing new , thought the british high command argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times it was believed that they were about to do it again but on april 2 argentine forces did the unexpected after many past false alarms , this time they actually invaded and seized the islands all argentine public statements emphasized the long standing historical claims to the falklands themselves but just for good measure , the next day a small argentine force also seized far off south georgia island the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina 's point of view however , the small contingent of 22 royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller russian attack plan thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces , a special commando team got onto the island undetected based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base , the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base special high speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense by late that evening , april 3 , the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible the joint rockefeller russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base once the hole was made , the next step was obvious the rockefeller russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april 3 can hardly be described , my friends the thatcher government , like the so called reagan administration here in america , is bolshevik controlled that 's why margaret thatcher always says , me , too any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries , and on the evening of april 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep , deep trouble immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic haste was the order of the day the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks , on or about april 24 if help did not reach south georgia by then , the secret installation might be doomed the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons to open the blast proof entrance doors would be suicide on april 5 , just two days after south georgia island was seized , some 40 naval ships began moving out of british ports the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister he was forced to resign , my friends , because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations that same day , april 5 , new zealand , the home of the other secret naval fleet , broke diplomatic relations with argentina the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on red alert as a precautionary measure , all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea several surface ships were already at sea undergoing sea trials , but that still left seven \( 7 \) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier on that busy day of april 5 , argentina 's foreign minister , costa mendez , was at the united nations in new york he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials he got them ! for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on that , my friends , was only a cover story the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base , a major battle was likely the official stories about slow movement of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be , the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island , then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14 , two days before it was announced officially shortly after they did so , they ran into trouble russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation in moments the ship was without any command , its communications and radar silenced then a russian sub closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly so far as is known , there were no survivors this unexpected shock in the mid atlantic produced two results , both important first , it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense , but that cost valuable time public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drilling continued the other result of the sinking was equally important word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic , which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble during the dead of night , early april 15 , the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands , 450 miles southeast of new zealand their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it , as i explained last month but once they arrived at the antipodes , the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters the antipodes headquarters , in turn , was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller russian planners had hoped for the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand ! the british ship 's sinking of april 14 was also followed by other events on april 15 the argentine navy started moving out of port the same day , alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires supposedly he was there as a diplomat , but in reality he was there as a general , dealing with generals haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel , as i have revealed in the past he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment four days later , april 19 , haig left for washington as he boarded his plane , haig somberly told reporters , time is running out and so it was , my friends , for the secret south georgia base the very next day , april 20 , the drill broke through into the hollowed out cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend the british fleet was still out of range the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small , compact russian neutron bomb when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave , the effects were devastating the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile , russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders from a distance , the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields , which also protect against beam weapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed floating overhead , the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range finding equipment known as prf as i have reported in the past , there is no method known by which prf can be jammed the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines the subs were armed with special non homing , non nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within 15 minutes after the attack began , all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom , and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time the time here in washington was around 2 00 p m april 23 that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister , francis pym pym was wearing the artificial pseudo smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public but not haig haig was grinning from ear to ear , and no wonder the joint rockefeller russian military operation had been a brilliant success the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out , bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet , while not totally wiped out , had been badly crippled by working together , the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic 3 as i say these words , news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic , but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain as soon as that takes place , military action will heat up fast around the falklands britain has no choice but to fight she has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle but by fighting , the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy meanwhile , the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast building , anti nuclear war campaign on all sides now we are hearing about the so called nuclear freeze movement there are documentaries , articles , publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war in recent months , there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously we are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before , yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time if you believe that , my friends , i give up movements like this never , and i mean never , develop without leadership , organization , and money and plenty of it what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work as i 've explained in the past , the rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place if it does , they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it instead , the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel , the bolsheviks here , will win out if there is a war and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war the present anti nuclear war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia but as russia 's new rulers know very well , this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group it 's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers the russians regard the united states as a house divided , and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all out , even suicidal , nuclear war but once that is done , they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti nuclear war propaganda that objective is renewed power and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign under bolshevik control , the so called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it 's scaring people the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power these days the smell of war is in the air the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war a new super united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill it will have teeth ! as presently envisioned , the new organization will be based in geneva , switzerland the working name , though this may be changed , is the world nonproliferation council the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties , but its true purpose will be to use fear the fear of war to control us all last minute summary now it 's time for my last minute summary in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so called falkland islands crisis the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear war timetable the attacks were successful , but the results remain to be seen one result , though , is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap britain 's waterloo at sea may well be at hand my friends , two factions are struggling for control over our united states the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear if we are ever to rise above their trickery , it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ , our only hope as the scripture tells us , our lord has not given us the spirit of fear but of power , of love , and of a sound mind we must learn to wage peace as our lord declared long ago , blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god

18	i'm not sure why you do n't consider it an option no one suggests that such analysis should be left to regulators in fact , the re inventing government movement provides just such a cost benefit approach to the analysis of public spending libertarians would do well to learn more about it okay , let me try to explain this when one votes for such a creature as a senator or , worse yet , a president , one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years as such , one 's influence is highly diluted i might add that , even if one were free to vote on individual regulations , the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation , combined with the very small chance of one 's vote making a difference , would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations sorry , but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach what is not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent tasks i'm not sure what you mean by feasible in this case do you mean that are impossible in priciple , or merely that it would be undesirable in fact \? actually , the only areas of public spending above that strike me as generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense 2 of the four you saw fit to mention , and education of minors is always another possibility , since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are \( it is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to be to a principle of non coercion , the only areas of public spending that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns hmmm \) you say this as if it were surprising , yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy all non coersive functions should be dealt with privately , therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones perhaps you have may i suggest that you consider that revolutionaries frequently generate support by acting as protectors of geezers , mothers and children governments that ignore such people on the grounds that we do n't have much to fear from them do so at their own peril much more likely it 's drunken teenagers the groups in questionare more likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before in the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm , let me say this directly the idea that such programs as social security or afdc should be considered defense \( an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups \) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration do you seriously dispute this \? i do n't want to seem patronizing , but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons \( like yourself \) who make the decisions i feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller i do n't expect you to agree with me , but you explain why you feel i'm wrong \?

18	agreed it is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams just as marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to wither away , libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition this is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds in this case , limited and big government are not defined i would point out that lebanon , somalia , and the former yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with limited government , while the us , canada , and nations in western europe \( where people would rather live \) are often pointed out as nations with big government from a libertarian point of view the argument is not between those who want limited government and those who want unlimited government it is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds jsh

7	archive name rec autos part6 new article as of 4 february 1993 rpw many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics rather fewer know how to do it this article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard unix systems a shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a sparc 2 here at balltown cma com for a number of mailing lists note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list , please let me know of the request address so that i can list it in the montly rec autos posting also inform the keeper of the usenet list of lists \( check news answers for this monthly posting \) first of all , to get anywhere , you need to either 1 \) be a sysadmin , or 2 \) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin it is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else , or that you have trouble getting email through , then your network connectivity is probably not good enough listserv there is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv , which is available from several ftp servers on the network details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article , but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully the alias file on a typical unix system there is a file named usr lib aliases on whichever file server is your mail host it contains lines such as foo bar , baz , bletch which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar , baz , and bletch thus , the simplest possible email list is my favorite car member1 , member2 , member3 , my address my favorite car request my address this has a couple of problems the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file however , you can do the following , with the connivance of your sysadmin my favorite car include home mydir misc autos my favorite car list my favorite car request my address where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses this file can be in the list admin 's home directory , owned by the list admin bounced mail this still has a problem bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list , which is generally considered somewhat irritating therefore , the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive \( thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup , by the way i'm not sure where he got it from \) school request welty school rebroadcast include home newwelty misc autos school list school usr local adm bin explscript school owner school school request owner school out school request here 's what is going on here the owner and request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network the request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties school is what people send mail to instead of pointing at addresses , it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email school broadcast \( of which nobody except me knows the name the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity \) points at the actual list members the shell script i use is as follows ! bin sh cd tmp sed e ' reply to d' e ' sender d' e ' from d' \( echo reply to 1 balltown cma com echo errors to 1 request balltown cma com echo sender 1 request balltown cma com cat \) usr lib sendmail om f 1 request balltown cma com f the 1 mailing list 1 rebroadcast exit 0 note that this script does not know the name of the list the name is passed in from outside , so that the script may be used for multiple lists \( i run several out of this site \) the script excises reply to , sender , and from lines from the incoming message , substitutes for sender and reply to , and adds errors to 99 9 of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the request or owner addresses if this header rewrite is done for digested lists , there is some digestification software around hopefully i 'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting richard welty \( welty balltown cma com \)

15	why do you assume that jesus 's plea to his father to let this cup pass from him , was merely a plea to escape death \? when i look at jesus in the garden , i see a man god , who all his life had had the presense of his father with him as a result , he knew every detail about his death long before the agony in the garden but as that hour approached , he felt abandoned by his father , his presense diminishing with each passing minute in addition , it was brought more and more to jesus 's attention \( the betrayal of judas was probably a big impact \) that his suffering would be to no avail for many people , especially those who would reject him , not only then but in the future i truly believe that the majority of jesus 's suffering was mental and spiritual , while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg btw , we know from john 's account that jesus shunned becomming an earthly king from john joh 6 14 after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus did , they began to say , surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world joh 6 15 jesus , knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force , withdrew again to a mountain by himself this does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king no , jesus knew his mission was to redeem all \( jew gentile \) people and establish his kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe this was utterly mistaken , much to jesus 's dismay , as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom but he knew what his father 's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of his passion

13	i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes above , lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps in most of this thread , i have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between einstein and the average post doc physicist is the quality of their thought but what is the difference between einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy \? \( some would give velikovsky or korzybski as examples if you do n't like these , choose your own \) i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this let me approach this from a second direction when one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference , there are many kinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind of criticism is that the work , while technically correct , is either not important or not interesting the first difference is the one that i have been pointing to the second difference is the one that lee lady seems to be discussing i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific , what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims , not just of some of its proposed remedies similarly , i suspect that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work what it lacks \( as one example \) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goal in areas where we do not yet have this , i see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses let 's face it we cannot always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything clear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can

13	i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake , they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation , thinking , and informal exploration as unscientific here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider , for example , a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate , but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that 95 of all animal species are invertebrates , that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form , that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems , etc in short , knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition i agree on both counts as an example of the second , it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective , despite a lack of controls as to the first , i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree , and in each field , practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim , the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it , and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative , to list what little evidence was presently available for them , and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work \( it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail \) i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice , that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds this is unfortunate , because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand , i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out , no one wants to become this generation 's rhine i think this is absurd i wonder why the results were not published in my field , dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished \( this certainly eases one 's defense \) finally , i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know little about either and so have nothing to offer

19	is it not the case that , in the eyes of the law , when someone is aware of something and has the capability of taking action and does not , that individual may be held responsible for that action \? example the driver of a getaway car may be held as an accomplice to murder the i did n't know defense spawned the ignorance of the law is no excuse when an individual is held as a material witness to a crime , is there a criminal charge against the individual \? if not , on what grounds is the person imprisoned \?
7	hi , maybe someone can help me here i am looking to buy this 1990 nissan maxima gxe for cdn 14000 right now the car has 96000 km \( or about 60000 miles \) on it a typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km \( or about 43k mi \) the seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards \( he said he will replace the components before selling the car to me \) being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars , i do n't know what this could mean is 96k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items \? or is this an indication that the car was abused \? would other things break down or have to be replaced soon \? the seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot , but , i do n't know how to verify this i 've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood , though although the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept , it 's currently out of warranty \( a similarly priced '90 accord with 70k km will have 2 years or 30k km worth of warranty left \) and i do n't want to worry about paying for any repair bills but , i also need a car for 5 people when will the new maxima come out , by the way \? i would very much appreciate your input in this please reply by e mail \( preferred \) or post in this newsgroup thanks ! ryan

\( 1 \) this report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992 in 1992 , 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the colorado department of health \( cdh \) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991 during 1992 , reported cases increased 22 7 and 17 5 among females and males , respectively \( table 1 \) similar increases occurred among blacks , whites , and hispanics \( 15 6 , 15 1 , and 15 9 , respectively \) however , the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88 from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9 7 of all reported cases in 1992 although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35 44 years \( 80 4 \) and greater than or equal to 45 years \( 87 7 \) , these age groups accounted for only 11 0 of all reported cases in 1992 persons in the 15 19 year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group specific rate \( 639 per 100 , 000 \) reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32 9 in the five county denver metropolitan area \( 1990 population

neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases \( stds \) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \( aids \) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity when compared with 1991 , the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic \( dmhc , the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area \) increased 33 in 1992 , and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2 4 concurrently , the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1 among self identified heterosexual men , the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at dmhc increased 33 and comprised 94 of all cases diagnosed in males , while the number of cases diagnosed among self identified homosexual men remained low \( 71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992 , respectively

page 14 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 increased since 1988 \( figure 1 \) during 1988 1992 , the population in colorado increased 9 9 for blacks , 9 8 for hispanics , and 4 5 for whites in 1992 , the gonorrhea rate for blacks \( 1935 per 100 , 000 persons \) was 57 times that for whites \( 34 per 100 , 000 \) and 12 times that for hispanics \( 156 per 100 , 000 \) \( table 1 \) among black

hospitals surveillance and information systems br , div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention , national center for prevention svcs , cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during 1991 1992 the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however , the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory \( which serves a network of clinics statewide \) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior , as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs \( 2 \) although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity , this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis \( 3 6 \) the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use , exchange of sex for money or drugs , and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 \( 1300 per 100 , 000 \) \( objective 19 1a \) \( 7 \) race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover , race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status , access to medical care , and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado , interventions initiated by the cdh std aids program include 1 \) targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk \( e g , 15 19 year old black females and 20 24 year old black males \) 2 \) implementing a media campaign \( e g , public service radio hicnet medical newsletter page 15 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 announcements , signs on city buses , newspaper advertisements , and posters in schools and clinics \) to promote awareness of std risk and prevention targeted primarily at high risk groups , and 3 \) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach

source mmwr 42 \( 14 \) date apr 16 , 1993 motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than 1 million years of potential life lost before age 65 annually \( 1 \) child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss \( 2 \) from 1977 through 1985 , all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8 59 \( 3 , 4 \) , motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children \( 1 \) , while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age \( 84 usage for those aged 0 4 years 57 , aged 5 11 years and 29 , aged 12 18 years \) \( 5 \) in addition , parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children \( 6 \) to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household , cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system \( brfss \) during 1988 and 1989 this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for 20 , 905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in

, 5499 \( 26 \) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child 's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were 1 \) consistent use \( i e , always buckle up \) and 2 \) less than consistent use \( i e , almost always , sometimes , rarely , or never buckle up \) data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis \( sudaan \) \( 7 \) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence

, 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years , but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1 \) those having a law requiring adult safety belt use \( law states \) , and 2 \) those without such a law \( no law states \) overall , 21 of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher \( p less than 0 05 , chi square test \) in law states than in no law states \( 81 1 versus 74 3 and 58 7 versus 43 2 , respectively \) high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use \( figure 1 \) adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child 's age \( range 95 5 for 1 year olds to 84 7 for 10 year olds \) in comparison , for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use , the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child \( range 93 1 for 1 year olds to 28 8 for 10 year olds \) when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users , 95 confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups \( i e , aged less than 1 and 1 year \) reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states , regardless of age of child \( table 1 \) in addition , higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children , a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use \( 8 \) reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion , cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children \( 6 , 9 \) because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors , children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury \( 10 \) educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly , occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status , such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs \( i e , head start \) that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition , however , efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 they become older parents , especially those with low educational attainment , those who do not consistently wear safety belts , and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws , should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally , the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group

metropolitan atlanta , georgia , and selected jurisdictions in california for the years 1983 1988 description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983 1988 for 639 , 837 births in california and 152 , 970 births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared , adjusting for race , sex , and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis , fetal alcohol syndrome , hip dislocation dysplasia , microcephalus , obstruction of the kidney ureter , and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however , differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction , encephalocele , spina bifida , or trisomy 21 \( down syndrome \) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment , because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida however , the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown , but may be related to variability in environmental exposure , heterogeneity in the gene pool , or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases , several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular , the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis authors jane schulman , ph d , nancy hicnet medical newsletter page 21 volume 6 ,

the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a \( h1n1 \) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only 7 of identified viruses were influenza a \( h3n2 \) , but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned , and it subsequently predominated during the 1989 90 season during the 1988 89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a \( h3n2 \) but not influenza a \( h1n1 \) interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a \( h1n1 \) and b

analogues \( lupron , depo lupron , synarel \) occasionally , however , ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia , we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit , with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies , ovulatory dysfunction , endometriosis , and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry , the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle results from our program , involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 ivf et cycles , reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless , the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age , response to exogenous ovarian stimulation , quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however , among these , age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore , it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that 1 \) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age 2 \) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years and 3 \) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present , age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center , therefore , is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal , and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently , the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room , usually with the use of a laparoscope and , in contrast to ivf et , involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube \( an average of 3 eggs tube \) under these circumstances , fertilization occurs in vivo and , if excess eggs are retrieved , the remainder undergo ivf , with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle , or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page 26 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction , endometriosis , male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique \( range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36 percent and for ivf et 14 to 18 percent \) in view of this fact , one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however , in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which , while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed , benefit the patient these concerns are 1 \) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room 2 \) the risks , albeit minimal , of undergoing general anesthesia and 3 \) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs , and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january 1 , 1991 , and december 31 , 1992 , we have performed a total of 12 gift cycles , with an overall success rate of 20 percent embryo cryopreservation , or freezing , is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs , but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore , as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs , from both a practical and an ethical standpoint , all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure , which is still very new , is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility \( less than 10 million sperm ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm , and or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology \) we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion \( szi \) , which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg , the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore , we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky , ph d hicnet medical newsletter page 27 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 ,

18	this is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution one approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while another approach is to try and amend the constitution the original constitution restrained the u s government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years , depending on just how one wants to count it the first amendment , though weakened in many ways , still restrains government \( particularly state and local \) , even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship i think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two \( not that i think that 's likely to happen \) not necessarily mr hendricks , but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism , that it cannot be stable that might be true , but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se if a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again , we would just be back where we are now this is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now , but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of , if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus

15	first by his fruits the messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth he also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin \( fallen nature \) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin he also wants to create world peace based on godism the messiah 's teachings will build on the foundation of the bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of god , the fall of man , the purpose of creation , and god 's providence of restoration it will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the world 's religions many christians expect jesus to come on literal clouds , so they may miss him when he returns just as the jewish people missed jesus 2000 years ago they are still waiting for his first coming the jewish people of that age expected elijah to come first jesus said that john the baptist was elijah but john the baptist denied that he was elijah \( how did this reflect on jesus \? \) later in prison john even questioned who jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look for another \( see book of matthew \) david koresh did n't even come close the problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real messiah when he does show up very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for christians how to recognize the second coming \? the messiah should not claim to be god what sets a messiah apart is that he is born without original sin he is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth adam and eve were born sinless but they fell , and this tragedy meant that it would take god thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as god originally intended god 's restoration providence is still not complete the messiah is the true son of god , one with god , god 's representative on the earth , but not god himself there is only one god who else in this world is claiming to be the messiah maybe he 's already here

18	it seems that conservatives are putting a lot of effort into showing up the 10 figure , but that really does n't make a difference like i said , who cares how many there are \? would the fact that they 're only 1 of the population justify discrimination against them \? i do n't think so uh , well , golly gee whiz let me see , when the new president , as his first big policy act tries to force homosexuals \( acceptance thereof \) on the military , despite polls showing a consistent 75 against it , and the minority is only 1 , well , gee , i sure think that is newsworthy tells you something about the fascist politics being practiced there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of environmental disaster weird , eh \?

12	not hard , you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software , but this hogs most of the available cpu cycles on a low end controller i 've seen some application note from philips that used one of their 8051 derivatives as a printer buffer , with up to 1mb of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bit banging another alternative would be to use one of those nice dram controller chips that create static ram appearance and all that , but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile
0	gregg , i'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things are n't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you , but exactly who is being childish here is open to question bbci was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank what will someone bet me they were n't real islamic owners and operators \? and yet it actually turned out to be a long running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors and why did these naive depositors put their life savings into bcci rather than the nasty interest motivated western bank down the street \? could it be that they believed an islamically owned and operated bank could n't possibly cheat them \? so please do n't try to con us into thinking that it will all work out right next time

13	avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life , perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case , a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science , we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today , because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense , since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact , because of the lack of a rigorous foundation , they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless , what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it 's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it 's not science taken to the extreme , i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing , an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism , where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing \( i do n't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless , it is one of the results \) and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results , i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore , the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology \( or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them \) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance , certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative \( one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion , a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin 's assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors \) i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science \( ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others \) and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

9	actually , they 're pretty worthless , if you want to evaluate players with stats rbis and runs scored should be banned all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself you uh , so \? you 've just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored that 's where obp , slg , runs created , linear weights , etc come in these simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player 's offensive contribution to the team 's runs scored thank you for making our case have a nice day

19	the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning michael siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed , in part , as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility indeed , many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one 's neighbor as following various other rules , and relying on their god to make things come out right , precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again , we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted \? there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to show that such readings are twisted , because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claims and commandments in addressing conservative christians , michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions that these conservative christians will reject but these base commandments are too vague to serve as a principle for the critique of ethical systems the meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them , from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other biblical passages , from a particular sectarian tradition , or from some combination of these things these commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems what meaning they have comes from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law , which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love god and love our neighbors there are many parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are straightforwardly read as ethical commandments the pauline epistles are similarly full if it is not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior , the problem is not a lack of raw material no , michael , the conservative christians also take the gospel seriously what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel in a sense , the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about christianity it tells us that the new testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge podge that it can serve as the source text for many , vastly different beliefs about the nature of the christian god and about what men should and should n't do the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays every christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra christian principles through which michael interprets his religion , and the homophobes apply the same christian principles , with equal justification , to their cause in short , it is the extra christian principles that make michael 's christianity beneficial , and i suspect they would be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by christian interpretation michael paints a picture of standard american atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretations of the bible but i think it is even more damaging to christianity to note that the new testament presents such a vague hodge podge of notions about the nature of god and the nature of the good \( except , of course , when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles \) here , i think we should apply a christian parable , where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value , but the lukewarm we should spit out
17	accounts of anti armenian human right violations in azerbaijan 008 part b prelude to current events in nagorno karabakh \( part b of 008 \) oh , yes , i just remembered while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently , let the armenian women have babies for us , muslim babies , let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians then they said , those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes ! they repeated it very often continued from part a the six of them left they left and i had an attack i realized that the dan ger was past , and stopped controlling myself i relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt my heart and kidneys hurt i had an awful kidney attack i rolled back and forth on top of those christmas ornaments , howling and howling i did n't know where i was or how long this went on when we figured out the time , later it turned out that i howled and was in pain for around an hour then all my strength was gone and i burst into tears , i started feeling sorry for myself , and so on and so forth then someone came into the room i think i hear someone calling my name i want to respond and restrain myself , i think that i'm hallucinating i am silent , and then it continues it seems that first a man 's voice is calling me , then a woman 's later i found out that mamma had sent our neighbor , the one whose apartment she was hiding in , uncle sabir kasumov , to our place , telling him , i know that they 've killed lyuda go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they do n't violate her corpse he went and returned empty handed , but mamma thought he just did n't want to carry the corpse into his apartment she sent him another time , and then sent his wife , and they were walking through the rooms looking for me , but i did n't answer their calls there was no light , they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps they started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock , and at 9 30 i went down to the kasumovs' i went down the stairs myself i walked out of the apartment how long can you wait for your own death , how long can you be cowardly , afraid \? come what will i walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next no one , not on the fifth floor , not on the fourth , opened the door on the third floor , on the landing of the stairway , uncle sabir 's son started to shout , aunt roza , do n't cry , lyuda 's alive ! he knocked on his own door and out came aunt tanya , igor , and after them , mamma aunt tanya , uncle sabir 's wife , is an urdmurt all of us were in their apartment i did n't see karina , but she was in their home , too , lying delirious , she had a fever marina was there too , and my father and mother all of my family had gathered there at the door i lost consciousness igor and aunt tanya carried me into the apartment later i found out what they had done to our karina mamma said , lyuda , karina 's in really serious condition , she 's probably dying if she recognizes you , do n't cry , do n't tell her that her face looks so awful it was as though her whole face was paralyzed , you know , everything was pushed over to one side , her eye was all swollen , and everything flowed together , her lips , her cheeks it was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict , that 's how disfigured her face was i said , fine mamma was afraid to go into the room , because she went in and hugged karina and started to cry i went in as soon as i saw her my legs gave way i fell down near the bed , hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying she opened the eye that was intact , looked at me , and said , who is it \? but i could barely talk , my whole face was so badly beaten i did n't say , but rather muttered something tender , something incomprehensible , but tender , my karochka , my karina , my little golden one she understood me then igor brought me some water , i drank it down and moistened karina 's lips she started to groan she was saying something to me , but i could n't understand it then i made out , it hurts , i hurt all over her hair was glued down with blood i stroked her forehead , her head , she had grit on her forehead , and on her lips she was groaning again , and i do n't know how to help her she calls me over with her hand , come closer i go to her she 's saying something to me , but i ca n't understand her igor brings her a pencil and paper and says , write it down she shakes her head as if to say , no , i ca n't write i ca n't understand what she 's saying she wanted to tell me something , but she could n't i say , karina , just lie there a little while , then maybe you 'll feel better and you can tell me then and then she says , maybe it 'll be too late and i completely just broke down , i could n't control myself then i moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye i dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips she says , lyuda , we 're not saved yet , we have to go somewhere else out of this damned house they want to kill us , i know they 'll find us here , too we need to call urshan she repeated this to me for almost a whole hour , until i understood her every word i ask , what 's his number \? urshan feyruzovich , that 's the head of the administration where she works we have to call him but i did n't know his home number i say , karina , what 's his number \? she says , i ca n't remember i say , who knows his number \? who can i call \? she says , i do n't know anything , leave me alone i went out of the room igor stayed to watch over her and sat there , he was crying , too i say , mamma , karina says that we have to call urshan how can we call him \? who knows his telephone number \? i tell marina , think , think , who can we call to find out \? she started calling several people did n't answer she called a girlfriend , her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back the boss 's wife answered and said he was at the dacha my voice keeps cracking , i ca n't talk normally she says , lyuda , do n't panic , get a hold of yourself , go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just ca n't do that she still did n't know what was really going on i said , it 's easy for you to say that , you do n't understand what 's happening they are killing people here i do n't think there is a single armenian left in the building , they 've cut them all up i'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves she says , well , ok , if it 's that serious and all the same she 's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that i'm fearing for my life , that in fact it 's not all that bad ok , fine , fine , she says , if you 're afraid , ok , as soon as urshan comes back i 'll send him over we called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under aunt tanya 's , on the second floor , asya dallakian 's apartment she was n't home , she was staying with her daughter in karabagh they destroyed everything there we realized that they still might come back we kept on trying to get through to aunt tanya urshan 's wife is named tanya too and finally we get through she says , yes , he 's come home , he 's leaving for your place now he came of course he did n't know what was happening , either , because he brought two of his daughters with him he came over in his jeep with his two daughters , like he was going on an outing he came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened he has grown up daughters , they 're almost my age the three of us carried out karina , tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf , and went down to his car he took karina and me to the maternity home no , first they took us to the po ice precinct they had stretchers ready as soon as we got out of the car they put karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we must n't move , we might have fractures from the stretcher i saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor , bandaged , on the concrete floor , groaning this was around eleven o'clock at night we had left the house somewhere around 1 30 when i saw those soldiers i realized that a war was going on soldiers , enemies everything just like a war they carried me into some office on the stretcher the emergency medical people from baku were there the medical attendant there was an older armenian urshan told him what they had done to karina because she 's so proud she would never have told and this aging armenian his name was uncle arkady , i think , because someone said arkady , get an injection ready , he started to fill a syringe , and turned around so as to give karina a shot but when he looked at her face he became ill and he was an old man , in his sixties , his hair was all grey , and his moustache , too he hugged karina and started to cry what have they done to you \? ! he was speaking armenian what have they done to you \? ! karina did n't say anything mamma came in then , and she started to cry , too the man tried to calm her i 'll give you a shot mamma tells him , i do n't need any shot where is the government \? just what are they doing \? look what they 've done to my children ! they 're killing people , and you 're just sitting here ! some teacups were standing on the table in there you 're sitting here drinking tea ! look what they 've done to my daughters ! look what they 've turned them into ! they gave her something to drink , some heart medicine , i think they gave karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the maternity home immediately papa and urshan , i think , even though papa was in bad shape , helped carry karina out when they put her on the stretcher , none of the medics got near her i do n't know , maybe there were n't any orderlies then they came to me what 's the matter with you \? their tone was so official that i wrapped myself tighter in the half length coat i had a blanket on , too , an orange one , aunt tanya 's i said , i'm fine uncle arkady came over and was soothing me , and then told the doctor , you leave , let a woman examine her a woman came , an azerbaijani , i believe , and said , what 's wrong with you \? i was wearing my sister lyuda 's nightshirt , the sister who at this time was in yerevan when she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby i tore the night shirt some more and showed her i took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her there was a huge wound , about the size of a hand , on my back , from the indian vase she said something to them and they gave me two shots she said that it should be dressed with something , but that they 'd do that in the hospital they put me on a stretcher , too they started looking for people to carry me i raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up , and this woman , i do n't know if she was a doctor or a nurse , said , lie still , you must n't move when i was lying back down i saw two policemen leading a man his profile seemed very familiar to me i shouted , stop ! one of the policemen turned and says , what do you want \? i say , bring him to me , i want to look at him they brought him over and i said , that person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister i recognize him , note it down they said , fine , but did n't write it down and led him on i do n't know where they were taking him then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting they went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer one of the soldiers started talking to me , sister i do n't remember the conversation exactly , but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us i asked him , where are you from \? he said that he was from ufa apparently they were the first that were brought in the ufa police later i learned that they suffered most of all he says , ok , you 're armenians , they did n't get along with you , but i'm a russian , he says , what are they trying to kill me for \? oh , i remembered something else when i went out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nails i looked out the window and saw two azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten he was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms , they were beating him with his own club the way he cried mamma made my skin crawl i do n't know what they did to him , if he 's still alive or not and something else before he attack on our house we saw sheets , clothes , and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building , but i did n't think it was azerbaijanis attacking armenians i thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they did n't need out , or someone was fighting with someone it was only later , when they were burning a passenger car in the yard , when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the armenians , that i realized that this was serious , that it was anti armenian they took karina and me to the sumgait maternity home mamma went to them too and said , i 've been beaten too , help me but they just ignored her my father went to them and said in a guilty voice , as though it was his fault that he 'd been beaten , and says , my ribs hurt so much , those creeps have probably broken my ribs please look at them the doctor says , that 's not my job urshan said , fine , i 'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor , i 'll find you one i 'll bring one and have him look at you and he drove them to his apartment marina and i stayed there they examined us i was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us i was n't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us , but i was very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the hippocratic oath could talk to victims like that by happy or unhappy coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our karina and she , having examined karina , said , no problem , you got off pretty good not like they did in kafan , when you armenians were killing and raping our women karina was in such terrible condition that she could n't say anything she would certainly have had something to say ! then they examined me the same story they put us in a separate ward no shots , no medicinal powders , no drugs absolutely none ! they did n't even give us tea all the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were armenians who had been raped and they started coming and peering through the keyhole , the way people look at zoo animals karina did n't see this , she was lying there , and i kept her from seeing it they put ira b in our ward she had also been raped true , she did n't have any serious bodily injuries , but when she told me what had happened at their place , i felt worse for them than i did for us because when they raped ira her daughter was in the room , she was under the bed on which it happened and ira was holding her daughter 's hand , the one who was hiding under the bed when they were beating ira or taking her earrings off , gold , when she involuntarily let go of her daughter 's hand , her daughter took her hand again her daughter is in the fourth grade , she 's 11 years old i felt really awful when i heard that ira asked them not to harm her daughter , she said , do what you want with me , just leave my daughter alone well , they did what they wanted they threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way now i would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night it was simply bartholomew 's night , i say , they did what they would love to do every day steal , kill , rape many are surprised that those animals did n't harm the children the beasts explained it like this this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years , and those children would be grown , and then , as they put it , we 'll come take the pleasure out of their lives , those children this was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years they were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation , just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915 , and that those girls could be of some use in 15 years this i heard from the investigators one of the victims testified to it that 's how they described their own natures , that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years , and in 100 years they themselves said that and this , too everyone is surprised that they did n't harm our marina many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much i do n't know why their eyes were red maybe because they had n't slept the night before , maybe for some other reason , i do n't know but they had n't been smoking and they were n't drunk , i'm positive , because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do and they spoke in a cultured fashion with marina little sister , do n't be afraid , we wo n't harm you , do n't look over there where i was , you might be frightened you 're a muslim , a muslim woman should n't see such things so they were really quite sober so we came out of that story alive each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day it was n't even a day , of those several hours father still ca n't look us in the eyes he still feels guilty for what happened to karina , mother , and me because of his nerves he 's started talk ing to himself , i 've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening listen , he 'll say , what could i do \? what could i do alone , how could i protect them \? i do n't know where to find the words , it 's not that i'm happy , but i am glad that he did n't see it all happen that 's the only thing they spared us or maybe it happened by chance of course he knows it all , but there 's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened and there were so many conversations karina and i spoke together in private , and we talked with mamma , too but father was never present at those conversations we spare him that , if you can say that and when the investigator comes to the house , we do n't speak with father present on february 29 , the next clay , karina and i were discharged from the hospital first they released me , but since martial law had been declared in the city , the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier there were many people there , armenian victims i met the tovmasian family there from them i learned that rafik and their uncle grant had died they were sure that both had died they were talking to me and raya , rafik 's wife and grant 's daughter , and her mother , were both crying then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard there 's a little one room house outside there , a recreation and reading area they took us in there the women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide the women were shouting they explained to them we want to hide you better because it 's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct we went into the little house there were no chairs or tables in there we had children with us and they were hungry we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed no one had anything with them it was just awful they kept us there for 24 hours from the window of the one room house you could see that there were azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct , as though they were spying on us the police precinct is surrounded by a wall , like a fence , and it 's electrified , but if they were standing on the wall , it means the electricity was shut off this brought great psychological pressure to bear on us , particularly on those who had n't just walked out of their apartments , but who had n't slept for 24 hours , or 48 , or those who had suffered physically and spiritually , the ones who had lost family members for us it was another ordeal we were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared we could n't see a single person , not in the courtyard and not in the windows we thought that they must have already been hiding under the building , that they must have some secret room down there people were panicking they started throwing themselves at one another that 's the way it is on a sinking ship we heard those people , mainly young people , whistling and whopping on the walls we felt that the end was approaching i was completely terrified i had left karina in the hospital and did n't know where my parents were i was sort of calm about my parents , i was thinking only about karina , if , heaven forbid , they should attack the hospital , they would immediately tell them that there was an armenian in there , and something terrible would happen to karina again , and she would n't be able to take it then soldiers with dogs appeared when they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence then they brought in about another 30 soldiers they all had machine guns in readiness , their fingers on the triggers we calmed down a little they brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands , and took the children to the toilet but we all sat there hungry , but to be honest , it would never have occurred to any of us that we had n't eaten for two days and that people do eat then , closer to nightfall , they brought a group of detained criminals they were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs one of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it raya tovmasian it was like a different woman had been substituted earlier she had been crying , wailing , and calling out oh , rafik ! , but when she heard about this such a rage came over her ! she jumped up , she had a coat on , and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone and suddenly there were soldiers , and dogs , and lots of people she ran over to them the bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall she went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him ! then , on to a second , and a third everyone was rooted to the spot not one of the soldiers moved , no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it and the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands , muttering something she came back and sat down , and something akin to a smile appeared on her face she became so quiet no tears , no cries then that round was over and she went back to beat them again she was walking and cursing terribly take that , and that , they killed my husband , the bastards , the creeps , and so on then she came back again and sat down she probably did this the whole night through , well , it was n't really night , no one slept she went five or six times and beat them and returned and she told the women , what are you sitting there for \? they killed your husbands and children , they raped , and you 're just sitting there you 're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened are n't you armenians \? she appealed to everyone , but no one got up i was just numb , i did n't have the strength to beat anyone , i could barely hold myself up , all the more so since i had been standing for so many hours i was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there were n't enough chairs , really it was the elderly and women with children who sat i was on my feet the whole time there was nothing to breathe , the door was closed , and the men were smoking the situation was deplorable at eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us , local policemen , azerbaijanis they said , get up they 've brought mattresses , you can wash up and put the children to bed now the women did n't want to leave this place , either the place had become like home , it was safe , there were soldiers with dogs if anyone went outside , the soldiers would say , oh , it 's our little family , and things like that the soldiers felt this love , and probably , for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders everyone spoke from the heart , cried , and hugged them and they , with their loaded machine guns in their hands , said , grandmother , you must n't approach me , i'm on guard our people would say , oh , that 's all right they hugged them , one woman even kissed one of the machine guns this was all terribly moving for me and the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs they took us up to the second floor and said , you can undress and sleep in here do n't be afraid , the precinct is on guard , and it 's quiet in the city this was the 29th , when the killing was going on in block 41a and in other places then we were told that all the armenians were being gathered at the sk club and at the city party committee they took us there on the way i asked them to stop at the maternity home i wanted to take karina with me i did n't know what was happening there they told me , do n't worry , the maternity home is full of soldiers , more than mothers to be so you can rest assured i say , well , i wo n't rest assured regardless , because the staff in there is capable of anything when i arrived at the city party committee it turned out that karina had already been brought there they had seen fit to release her from the hospi tal , deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care once we were in the city party committee we gave free reign to our tears we met acquaintances , but everyone was somehow divided into two groups , those who had n't been injured , who were clothed , who had brought a pot of food with them , and so on , and those , like me , like raya , who were wearing whatever had come their way there were even people who were all made up , dolled up like they had come from a wedding there were people without shoes , naked people , hungry people , those who were crying , and those who had lost someone and of course the stories and the talk were flying oh , i heard that they killed him ! what do you mean they killed him ! he stayed at work ! do you know what 's happening at this and such a plant \? talk like that and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian , the teacher i know him very well and respect him highly i 've known him for a long time they had a small room , well really it was more like a study room we spent a whole night talking in that study once on march 1 we heard that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr had arrived everyone ran to see bagirov , what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside he arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things everyone was in a tremendous rage but he was protected by soldiers , and he went up to the second floor and did n't deign to speak with the people apparently he had more important things to do several hours passed gukasian called me and says , lyudochka , find another two or three we 're going to make up lists , they asked for them upstairs , lists of the dead , those whose whereabouts are unknown , and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned i had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said , lyuda , your mamma has arrived , she 's looking for you , she does n't believe that you are alive and well and that you 're here i gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what i was doing and went off the list was imprecise , of course it included grant adamian , raya tovmasian 's father , who was alive , but at the time they thought him dead there was engels grigorian 's father and aunt , cherkez and maria the list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor , zhanna agabekian one of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater we put her on the list too , and cried , but later it turned out that that was just a rumor , that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk , where , thank god , she was alive and well i should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead 3 all the lists were taken to bagirov i do n't remember how many dead were contained in the list , but it 's a fact that when gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate i asked , what 's going on \? he said , lyuda , can you imagine what animals , what scoundrels they are ! they say that they lost the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr has just arrived , and we were supposed to submit the list to him , so that he 'd see the scope of the slaughter , of the tragedy , whether it was one or fifty they told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who had n't left for the khimik boarding house all over again there were 26 people on our second list i think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio , because that 's the list that demichev got i remember exactly that there were 26 people on the list , i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list he said , lyuda , please , try to remember at least one more but i could n't remember anyone else but there were more than 30 dead of that i am certain the government and the procuracy do n't count the people who died of fright , like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock they were n't registered as victims of the sumgait tragedy and then there may be people we did n't know so many people left sumgait between march 1 and 8 ! most of them left for smaller towns in russia , and especially to the northern caucasus , to stavropol , and the krasnodarsk territory we do n't have any information on them i know that there are people who set out for parts around moscow in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there was a call for people who know how to milk cows , and for mechanics , and drivers , and i know a whole group of people went to help out also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city , who were burned in their cars no one knows about them , except the azerbaijanis , who are hardly likely to say anything about it and there 's more a great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the procuracy i know of three instances for sure , and i of course do n't know them all i'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened , that is , they did n't take the matter to court , they simply left but in so doing they did n't cease being victims one of them is the first cousin of my classmate kocharian she lived in microdistrict no 8 , on the fifth floor i ca n't tell you the building number and i do n't know her name then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives , she lived in microdistrict 1 near the gift shop i do n't know her name , she lives on the same landing as the sumgait procurator they beat her father , he was holding the door while his daughter hid , but he could n't hold the door forever , and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid like the azerbaijanis were saying , it was a very cultured mob , because they did n't kill anyone , they only raped them and left and the third one i do n't remember who the third one was anymore they transferred us on march 1 karina still was n't herself yes , we lived for days in the sk , in the cultural facility , and at the khimik they lived there and i lived at the city party committee because i could n't stay with karina it was too difficult for me , but i was at peace she had survived i could already walk , but really it was honest words that held me up thanks to the social work i did there , i managed to persevere aleksandr mikhailovich said , if it were n't for the work i would go insane he and i put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food , and we went to get them the first days we bought everything , although we should have received it for free they were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge , and they sold it to us then , when we found out it was free , we went to krayev at the time , fortunately , you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor , all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue on march 2 they sent two investigators to see us andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the way it worked out , in our family they had considered only karina and me victims , maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital mother and father are considered witnesses , but not victims shirokov was involved with karina 's case , and bibishev , with mine after i told him everything , he and i planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind we did n't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions were n't there the investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation was n't conducive to working there were n't enough automobiles , especially during the time when there was a curfew , and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts , and no still or video cameras i think that this was done on purpose we 're not so poor that we ca n't supply our investigators with all that stuff it was done especially to draw out the investigation , all the more so since the local authorities saw that the armenians were leaving at the speed of light , never to return to sumgait and the armenians had a lot to say i came to an agreement with bibishev , i told him myself , do n't you worry , if it takes us a month or two months , i 'll be here i'm not afraid , i looked death in the eyes five times in those two days , i 'll help you conduct the investigation he and i worked together a great deal , and i used this to shelter karina , i gave them so much to do that for a while they did n't have the time to get to her , so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her self she was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x rays she could n't eat or drink for nine days , she was nauseous i did n't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days then , on the fifth day , when we were in baku already , the investigator told me , how long can you go on like this \? well fine , so you do n't want to eat , you do n't love yourself , you 're not taking care of yourself , but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through we need you then i started eating , because in fact i was exhausted it was n't enough that i kept seeing those faces in our apart ment in my mind , every day i went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons i do n't know we were just everywhere ! probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of sumgait at that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement thus far i have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment mamma identified three , and karina , two the total is 36 marina did n't identify anyone , she remembers the faces of two or three , but they were n't among the photographs of those detained i told of the neighbor i recognized the one who went after the axe he still has n't been detained , he 's still on the loose he 's gone , and it 's not clear if he will be found or not i do n't know his first or last name i know which building he lived in and i know his sisters' faces but he 's not in the city the investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him the 31 people i identified are largely blue collar workers from various plants , without education , and of the very lowest level in every respect mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years there was one who was 48 only one of them was a student he was attending the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait , his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga tor once , thinking that i was an employee and not a victim , she said in front of me i 'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of armenia , that is , to keep him from landing in a prison on armenian soil they 're all terribly afraid of that , because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal does n't confess even though we identified him , they tell him in order to apply psychological pressure they say , fine , do n't confess , just keep silent when you 're in an armenian prison , when they find out who you are , they 'll take care of you in short order that somehow gets to them many give in and start to talk the investigators and i were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment , as an investigative experiment it was only then that i saw the way they had left our apartment even without knowing who was in our apartment , you could guess they stole , for example , all the money and all the valuables , but did n't take a single book they tore them up , burned them , poured water on them , and hacked them with axes only the materials from the 27th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore cooper 's last of the mohigans oh yes , lunch was ready , we were boiling a chicken , and there were lemons for tea on the table after they had been in our apartment , both the chicken and the lemons were gone that 's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment , people who do n't even know anything about books they did n't take a single book , but they did take worn clothing , food , and even the cheapest of the cheap , worn out slippers of those whom i identified , four were kafan azerbaijanis living in sumgait basically , the group that went seeking revenge let 's use their word for it was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill seekers i talked with one of them he had gray eyes , and somehow against the back drop of all that black i remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment , he was also involved in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building 16 she was an older armenian who had recently arrived from georgia , she lived alone and did not have anyone in sumgait i do n't know why she had a last name like that , maybe she was married to an azerbaijani i had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice , and know nothing about her i do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe murdering her was n't enough for them they hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water i remember another guy really well too , he was also rather fair skinned you know , all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark , both their hair and their skin and in contrast with them , in addition to the grey eyed one , i remember this one fellow , the one l took to be a lezgin i identified him as it turned out he was eduard robertovich grigorian , born in the city of sumgait , and he had been convicted twice one of our own how did i remember him \? the name rita was tattooed on his left or right hand i kept thinking , is that rita or puma , which it would be if you read the word as latin characters instead of cyrillic , because the cyrillic t was the one that looks like a latin m when they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back this was at the confrontation he swore on every holy book , tried to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion , and told me that i was making a mistake , and called me dear sister he said , you 're wrong , how could i , an armenian , raise my hand against my own , an armenian , and so on he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me , lyuda , are you sure it was he \? i told him , i 'll tell you one more identifying mark if i'm wrong i shall apologize and say i was mistaken the name rita is tattooed on his left or right hand he went rigid and became pale they told him , put your hands on the table he put his hands on the table with the palms up i said , now turn your hands over , but he did n't turn his hands over now this infuriated me if he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he had n't wanted to do it , that they forced him or something else , i would have treated him somewhat differently but he insolently stuck to his story , no , i did not do anything , it was n't me when they turned his hands over the name rita was in fact tattooed on his hand his face distorted and he whispered something wicked i immediately flew into a rage there was an ashtray on the table , a really heavy one , made out of granite or something , very large , and it had ashes and butts in it catching myself quite by surprise , i hurled that ashtray at him but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall , and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back and he smiled when he smiled it provoked me further i do n't know how , but i jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him i no longer remember which when i jumped i caught the microphone cord the investigator was there , tolya i no longer recall his last name , and he says , lyudochka , it 's a japanese microphone ! please and shut off all the equipment on the spot , it was all being video taped they took him away i stayed , and they talked to me a little to calm me down , because we needed to go on working , i only remember tolya telling me , you 're some actress ! what a performance ! i said , tolya , honestly beforehand they would always tell me , lyuda , more emotion you speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you i say , i do n't have any more strength or emotion all my emotions are behind me now , i no longer have the strength i do n't have the strength to do anything and he says , lyuda , how were you able to do that \? and when i returned to normal , drinking tea and watching the tape , i said , can i really have jumped over that table \? i never jumped that high in gym class so you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international of the 36 we identified there was an armenian , a russian , vadim vorobyev , who beat mamma , and 34 azerbaijanis at the second meeting with grigorian , when he had completely confessed his guilt , he told of how on february 27 the azerbaijanis had come knocking among them were guys if you can call them guys he knew from prison they said , tomorrow we 're going after the armenians meet us at the bus station at three o'clock he said , no , i'm not coming they told him , if you do n't come we 'll kill you he said , alright , i 'll come and he went they also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict , kamo pogosian he had also been in prison i think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed they called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing tomorrow we 're going to get the armenians be there he said , no they pulled a knife on him he said , i'm not going all the same and in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times , in the stomach he was taken to the hospital i know he was in the hospital in baku , in the republic hospital if we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th i 'll return to grigorian , what he did in our apartment i remember that he beat me along with all the rest he spoke azerbaijani extremely well but he was very fair skinned , maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him , too but later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian i do n't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment i did n't see , i do n't remember but the people who were in our apartment who did n't yet know that he was an armenian said that he did i do n't know if he confessed or not , and i myself do n't recall because i blacked out very often but i think that he did n't participate in the rape of karina because he was in the apartment the whole time when they carried her into the courtyard , he remained in the apartment at one point i was talking with an acquaintance about edik grigorian from her i learned that his wife was a dressmaker , his mother is russian , he does n't have a father , and that he 's been convicted twice well this will be his third and , i hope , last sentence he beat his wife , she was eternally coming to work with bruises his wife was an armenian by the name of rita the others who were detained well they 're little beasts you really ca n't call them beasts , they 're just little beasts they were robots carrying out someone else 's will , because at the investigation they all said , i do n't understand how i could have done that , i was out of my head but we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it , that 's why they did it in the name of allah , in the name of the koran , in the name of propagating islam that 's holy to them that 's why they did everything they were commanded to do because i saw they did n't have minds of their own , i'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values no education , they work , have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly , they crowd them in , like at the temporary housing , and apparently , they were promised that if they slaughtered the armenians they would receive apartments so off they went many of them explained their participation saying , they promised us apartments among them was one who genuinely repented i am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident he worked at a children 's home , an azerbaijani , he has two children , and his wife works at the children 's home too everything that they acquired , everything that they have they earned by their own labor , and was n't inherited from parents or grandparents and he said , i did n't need anything i just do n't know how i ended up in that it was like some hand was guiding me i had no will of my own , i had no strength , no masculine dignity , nothing and the whole time i kept repeating , now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes he sat there and just wailed but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat was not detained he performed a marvelous disappearing act , but i think that they 'll get onto him , they just have to work a little , because that vadim , that boy , according to his grandfather , is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do , how to cover his tracks he was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he did n't , either , and other things as well , and changed himself like a chameleon so they would n't get onto him , but he was detained that one in the eskimo dogskin coat was at the gambarians' after aleksandr gambarian was murdered he came in and said , let 's go , enough , you 've spilled enough blood here maybe karina does n't know this but the reason they did n't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them i heard this from aunt tanya and her sons , the kasumovs , who were in the courtyard near the entryway they liked her very much , and they had decided to take her to home with them when karina came to at one point she does n't remember this yet , this the neighbors old me and she saw that there was no one around her , she started crawling to the entryway they saw that she was still alive and came back , they were already at the third entryway , on their way to the gambarians' they came back and started beating her to finish her if she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries , they would have beat her less an older woman from our building , aunt nazan , an azerbaijani , all but lay on top of karina , crying and pleading that they leave her alone , but they flung her off the woman 's grown sons were right nearby they picked her up in their hands and led her home she howled and cried out loudly and swore god is on earth , he sees everything , and he wo n't forgive this there was another woman , too , aunt fatima , a sick , aging woman from the first floor , she 's already retired mountain dwellers , and azerbaijanis , too , have a custom if men are fighting , they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them but they trampled her scarf and sent her home to trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman 's honor now that the investigation is going on , now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little , i think about how could these events that are now called the sumgait tragedy happen \? how did they come about \? how did it start \? could it have been avoided \? well , it 's clear that without a signal , without permission from the top leadership , it would not have happened all the same , i'm not afraid to say this , the azerbaijanis , let other worthy people take no offense , the better representatives of their nations , let them take no offense , but the azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law , fear of retribution for what they have done and when the law said that they could do all that , like unleashed dogs who were afraid they would n't have time to do everything , they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done , to snatch a bit more the smell of the danger was already in the air on february 27 you could tell that something was going to happen and everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs many left for their dachas , got plane tickets for the other end of the country , just got as far away as their legs would carry them february 27 was a saturday i was teaching my third class the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out , that there had been a call from the city party committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at lenin square well , i excused the children , and there were few teachers left at school , altogether three women , the director , and six or seven men the rest had already gone home we got to lenin square and there were a great many people there this was around five thirty or six in the evening , no later they were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily , roaring they spoke over the microphone about what had happened in kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus the speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness , that he had seen it himself the crowd started to rage death to the armenians ! they must be killed ! then a woman went up on stage i did n't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies i could only hear her the woman introduced herself as coming from kafan , and said that the armenians cut her daughters' breasts off , and called , sons , avenge my daughters ! that was enough a portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories , toward the beginning of lenin street we stood there about an hour then the director of school 25 spoke , he gave a very nationalist speech he said , brother muslims , kill the armenians ! this he repeated every other sentence when he said this the crowd supported him stormily , whistling and shouting karabagh ! he said , karabagh has been our territory my whole life long , karabagh is my soul how can you tear out my heart \? as though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh it 's our territory , the armenians will never see it the armenians must be eliminated from time immemorial muslims have cleansed the land of infidel armenians , from time immemorial , that 's the way nature created it , that every 20 to 30 years the azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth by filth he meant armenians i heard this before that i had n't been listening to the speeches closely many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium , talking shop with the other teachers , and somehow it all went right by , it did n't penetrate , that in fact something serious was taking place then , when one of our teachers said , listen to what he 's saying , listen to what idiocy he 's spouting , we listened that was the speech of that director before that we listened to the woman 's speech right then in our group there were nine of us the mood changed , and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten our director of studies , for whom i had great respect , he 's an azerbaijani before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person , if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him , he seemed like a good person so he tells me , lyuda , you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square \? if they find out that you 're an armenian they 'll tear you to pieces should i tell them you 're an armenian \? should i tell them you 're an armenian \? when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it , and then he asked me a second time i turned to the director , khudurova , and said that it was already after eight , i was expected at home , and i should be leaving she answered , no , they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock , and men , until twelve stay here there was a young teacher with us , her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts she asked to leave i left my children at the kindergarten the director excused her when she let her go i turned around , said , good bye , and left with the young teacher , the azerbaijani i did n't see them after that when we were walking the buses were n't running , and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us they had apparently gotten all fired up it must have become too much for them , and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately , so they rushed off i was n't afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher would n't say that i was an armenian to make it short , we reached home then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there i started telling of my experience and again my parents did n't understand that we were in danger we watched television as usual , and did n't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day that 's how it all was at the city party committee i met an acquaintance , we went to school together , zhanna , i do n't remember her last name , she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street she was there with her father , for some reason she does n't have a mother the two of them were at home alone while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor , and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there was n't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony , there was no one there , they were all standing near the entryway that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there she jumped she jumped and did n't feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few days later i found out that she could n't stand up , she had been injured somehow that 's how people in sumgait saved their lives , their honor , and their children any way they could where it was possible , the armenians fought back my father 's first cousin , armen m , lives in block 30 they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes , knives , even with muskets and went up to the roof they took their infants with them , and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months , they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited , ready to fight then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage , she 's an azerbaijani who lived in their building they called the school board director and told her that if she did n't help them , the 17 armenians on the roof , to escape alive and unharmed , she 'd never see her daughter again i'm sure , of course , that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman , it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time she called the police the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof , and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment , into block 30 that 's how they defended themselves i heard that our neighbors , roman and sasha gambarian , resisted they 're big , strong guys their father was killed and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father , but were able to save their mother one of the neighbors told me that after it happened , when they were looking for the criminals on march 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected , people hid people in our entryway , maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there , and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses i do n't know how many even if they had been wounded and put down there , after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection that basement was filled with water i heard this from the neighbors and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it i know , too , that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment and our neighbor carried out our carpet , along with the rest he stole it for himself , posing as one of the criminals everyone was taking his own share , and the neighbor took his , too , and carried it home and when we came back , when everything seemed to have calmed down , he returned it , saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to save raya 's husband and father defended themselves the trdatovs defended themselves , and so did other armenian families to be sure there were azerbaijani victims , although we 'll never hear anything about them for some reason our government does n't want to say that the armenians were not just victims , but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers , too in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a military man , an officer , said that the armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves but that 's not important , the truth will come out regardless so that 's the price we paid those three days for three days our courage , our bravery , and our humanity was tested it was those three days , and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them , that showed what we 've become , what we grew up to be those three days showed who was who on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy it should be said that it 's not over yet , the trials are still ahead of us , and the punishments received by those who so violated us , who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators , the procuracy , and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga tion that 's the price we paid to live in armenia , to not fear going out on the street at night , to not be afraid to say we 're armenians , and to not fear speaking our native tongue october 15 , 1988 yerevan reference for 008 1 the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan , volume i , eyewitness accounts , edited

13	subject re eugenics probably within 50 years , a new type of eugenics will be possible maybe even sooner we are now mapping the human genome we will then start to work on manipulation of that genome using genetic engineering , we will be able to insert whatever genes we want no breeding , no hybrids , etc the ethical question is , should we \? two past problems with eugenics have been 1 \) reducing the gene pool and 2 \) defining the status of the eugenized inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny then they may be able to crowd out garbage genes this may in the future become possible even if it does , awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial africa and for diabetes in the hopi promoted survival in some conditions we do n't really know what the future may hold for our environment the reduced wilderness and disease survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind vulcanism , nuclear winter , ice age , meteor impact , new microbiological threats , famine , global warming , etc , etc , are all conceivable therefore , having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival of course , the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else 's but if we could make philosopher kings with great bodies and long lives , would we \( or they \) want to give them elevated status \? we could the romans did it with their kings without the benefits of such eugenics the race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused , but for a while , it was a problem orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks but there is nothing new under the sun we treated slaves the same way for millennia before 1984 i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time that has n't stopped the race as a whole yet many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change however , also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power the ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others , and have survived by making better choices when their turns came not that i do n't think that this gene altering power could n't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that , too the real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally do n't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few we , as eugenists , may make it , an we may not if we do n't , i hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will pull us through i believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same man needs to accept input from the great spirit of god to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has some men have , and i believe all men may , listen to and obey the still small voice of god in their hearts this is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices peoples have died out for many reasons the societies which failed to accept enough input from god to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves , and often others in the process it is self evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far , or else have n't had enough power for long enough in summary , i would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one and the answer , in some ways hard , in some ways easy , is the same ancient answer it is n't the power , it is the spirit sorry for the long post got carried away

0	see , we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here earlier , you said that it must be a conscious act by your definition , no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality you are trying to apply human terms to non humans i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative , this does not prevent his behavior from being moral i try to show it , but by your definition , it ca n't be shown and , morality can be thought of a large class of princples it could be defined in terms of many things the laws of physics if you wish however , it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of phyics it is less silly to talk about animals , as they have at least some free will

3	i have been following this thread and figured i 'd throw in my two cents the amiga zorro ii bus is comparable with the isa bus \( 7 16 vs 8 33 mhz \) the amiga has had a pre emptative multi tasking os since '85 and can operate with 1 mb ram ! scsi is used almost exclusively on these systems a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory a controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices this is espically true with scsi tape units for example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus this greatly increases productivity or , at least , do something else while backing up your hard drive \) which happens to be what i am doing while reading this group its a long story , but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which , thanks to scsi , i can move between both machines if , and when , scsi is better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines , i plan to completely get rid of ide wayne summer amiga simply the best palm bay , fl us x wayne amtower spacecoast org

15	my last article included this quote if any substantial number of talk religion misc readers read some wittgenstein , 60 of the postings would disappear \( if they understood some wittgenstein , 98 would disappear \) \) michael l siemon there is a convention called a `smiley' , which looks like this \) it is supposed to look like a sideways smiley face , and indicates that the preceding comment is supposed to be funny and , i 'll note that i have participated on talk religion misc for over five years i 'd say mr siemon was not too far off 8 \) in the meat of his reply , mr boundary serves up an excellent example of what i meant by there is no way out of the loop i wrote that human brains are infested with sin , and can be trusted only in limited circumstances which just moves the problem back one level how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed \? the only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed ness of your own conscience in other words , you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time , i 'll grant , but it 's not a valid way of reasoning unless you are infallible , your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain therefore , it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed' \( whatever that is supposed to mean \) mr boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem the church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation \? how do you know \? presumably , you believe this because of some argument or another how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes \? you write but there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible' i am confident about a lot of things , but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident' this discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain \( really , go check the subject line \) saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident when you say that you are confident , that invites people to ask why except in very limited circumstances , when you say that you are absolutely certain , it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility i have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning all of them every last one has claimed that he was himself infallible the result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu this particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism i get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion , and that the difference can have eternal consequences when i say that i think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there , i will admit that as you say the reasoning processes i used to reach this are fallible thus at least in principle i could be wrong but these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the bible that i think it 's unlikely that i'm misinterpreting it \( in order to get this level of confidence , i 've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues i have n't , for example said that all non christians will definitely end up in hell , and i have n't attempted to describe hell in any detail \) i have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though i acknowledge that i'm fallible and so there 's some chance i'm wrong do n't get me wrong i think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant christians , and often criticism of us is justified but in at least some cases i think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger if the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions , it 's not my fault i'm just telling it the way i think it is you may think god is immoral for setting things up that way it 's one of the critiques of christianity that i find it most difficult to respond to but it 's not arrogance for me to tell what i think is the truth

11	better yet , instead of thrashing around on the dos file system , take it a step further write yourself a minimal file system program that is used to create delete files , en decrypt them to ramdisk , list a directory put the util , password protected , on a floppy the catch is that the storage space used by this util is not part of the dos file system instead , defrag your disk , thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0 n then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system or , leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to dos another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files \( dos system files , for instance \) due to dos allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster these dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your disk at all \)

2	a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however , during this process i have come up with new problems 1 \) there seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb \? 2 \) it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command , \( provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names \) but how is one meant to update a database \? a \) a dde sql update command does not seem to work b \) initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur \( the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated , i guess \) c \) access does not allow vb to dde poke the information the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key strokes vb sends are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions \? are there any better work arounds to the above \? are there any signs of an odbc driver for access \?
16	the wall street journal had an article on how the police were whining about all the new guns excuse me , but police are employees of the government rather like having your janitor complain about job conditions i say californians should form armed block clubs that would engage in coordinated strategies should batf attempt to disarm them based on the nefarious tipster theory of law enforcement unlike waco , californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city streets with incendiary weapons , acetylene after slowing them down with abandoned car blockades m 1 garands should easily outclass batf shock troops with their h k mp 5 smgs , and there should be enough sony walkmans and boom boxes to overwhelm any fbi psy war operation yes , a good time would be had by all billary clinton would get what he wanted , a war on gunowners , the batf would attempt to show the anti gun press they they really , really were in charge with a 500 man charge of the light brigade , and the fbi would attempt to show how they really were in charge by asking the californian national guard to level the area with artillary !

15	science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising one aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world it is objective anything which affects the physical world can be studied for example , since we are part of the physical world , anything \( including spirits \) which affects our behaviour can be observed science does not make any claims about the existence or non existence of objects which do not affect the physical world the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world the model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations one of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world , and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions at the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a spiritual world as the non spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models the scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones , whereas many religions claim to represent the truth the arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth , this cannot be said of scientists

17	in the south lebanon area , only israeli \( and sla \) and lebanese troops are present syrian troops are deployed north of the awali river between the awali river and the security zone only lebanese troops are stationed that is your opinion and the opinion of the israeli government i agree peace guarantees would be better for all , but i am addressing the problem as it stands now hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon , and will include security guarantees for both sides my proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period in my opinion , if israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying the israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move i hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs , that 's why i post to tpm as i explained , i contend that if israel does withdraw unilaterally i believe no attacks would ensue against northern israel i also explained why i believe that to be the case my suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides it is unfortunate that israel does not agree with my opinion that is too bad because israel is not occupying the security zone free of charge it is paying the price for that once israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives , that is my contention if lebanon were willing to agree to that is completely untrue hizbollah is now a minor force in lebanese politics the real heavy weights are syria 's allies the gov't is supported by syria the lebanese army is over 30 , 000 troops and unified like never before hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking israel proper , especially after israeli withdrawal that would draw the ire of the lebanese the syrian and the israeli gov'ts if israel does withdraw and such an act \( hizbolllah attacking israel \) would be akin to political and moral suicide basil

19	and i maintain some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters , because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms and so , by their own choice , they will remain in darkness , sort of like bugs under a rock however , some people , but not many , will not like the darkness sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable these people will crawl out from under the rock , and , although blinded at first , will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth and , after a while , now that they can see things for what they really are , they will also see the heights which they can reach , and the places they can go , and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world , and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes they will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock they will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky , and that life on their own terms is great so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it do you see my point \? i think you 're the one under the rock , and i'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism come and join me ! it will be a difficult trip at first , until you build up your muscles for the long hike , but it 's well worth it ! look , you just practically equated odin and zeus \? they 're as much different as your god is from them do n't you see \? i'm not going to accept anything that i ca n't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses , especially not something as mega powerful as what you 're trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly , you must have a good reason to , do n't you \? when did i say that \? i say that i would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of a deity , but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am , then so be it nope most people are christian most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect , of believing that the world is an undesirable place , of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again , of doing just as their priests tell them , like good little sheep you enjoy darkness , and you 're proud of it you may know the bible well but have you read any of the koran \? or zen writings \? or hare krishna literature \? if you have n't , then how can you say you have an open mind \? nope you make decisions , enjoy your successes , and accept your failures then you die if you are content with the life you 've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments , then you 've led a good life please do i'm sorry , i do n't feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god i 'd worship would do , unless the sacrifice was only temporary , in which case it 's not really all that important forget the bible for a minute forget quoting verses , forget about who said what about this or that show me picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop , and convince me that you 're right

9	philadelphia at chicago teams tied for 1st after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series one friday , one saturday , and a good old sunday doubleheader what could be better , declared ernie banks perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging \? it 's pitching , it 's always been pitching that we 've lacked , announced ryne sandberg if we can get by brewer , then beat carlton , alexander , or bunning preferrably 2 of the last three we 'll know we might be able to win lord , i hope we pull it off the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled , pete rose followed with a hit , sending ashburn around second kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center , and threw a bullet in to ernie banks , who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third rose went to second on the play christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center , moving pete rose to third schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 130 150 walks this year chuck klein is starting to hit very well , and he lashed a double into a gap in right center cool papa bell 's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring nellie fox was walked , and bob boone grounded out to second , ending the threat teams are starting to realize that you do n't have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti , and that is lowering their run total it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen \( who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first \) , and it 's a credit to the phillies that they 've been able to sustain their pace the picthers have slumped at times so came the analysis from frank chance the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit , thomas' grounder moved him to second , and after sandberg made out billy williams singled home a run in the sixth , ron santo launched a two run homer to make it 3 1 dick redding got in trouble in the eighth , as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third ed reulbach entered to face fox , but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit allen doubled to right , but luckily for the cubs , williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third lance parrish , hitting for boone , was walked , and bruce sutter entered larry bowa grounded into a 1 2 3 double play , but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter desiring a strikeout , since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinch running at third , chance brought in lee smith , who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder , ending the inning the cubs took the win , 3 2 , moving a game behind the phillies steve carlton was called upon to battle 3 finger brown saturday to get another righthander in the lineup , ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third unfortunately , brown allowed six doubles , and the cub bullpen was worn down even more , as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty madlock , batting sixth , had knocked two doubles of his own , driving home four runs gabby hartnett hit two home runs , and cuyler added another , and the score was 8 6 , cubs after six innings the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth , as the cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11 7 triumph sunday 's twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point , including a rare outside the park home run in the second game , off robin roberts grover alexander of the phils took the first contest , 4 2 , but the cubs captured the second one 5 4 , with waddell gaining the win bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save , though he allowed one run in the eighth the cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders , and would conclude their series with the expos on monday montreal at st louis \( august 3 6 \) 3 way tie for 1st dennis martinez is on a roll , and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters , and while they are n't among the all time greats , they are getting the job done after winning their first first two games , they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 2 games out of first in this wacky season martinez triumphed 5 3 on friday , and williams outdueled dizzy dean 3 2 saturday however , the cardinals refused to give up , winning 6 2 on sunday the cards captured monday 's game , too , as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers 3 2 we 're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed , remarked lou brock i do n't see why we ca n't win this division the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them two thirds of the way through the season , there is a 3 way tie for first new york at pittsburgh \( august 3 6 \) 3 straight 3 2 wins for bucs , now 2 back but in 4th ! when your team is in a slump like we are , the worst thing is to play in a pitcher 's park like this , spoke gil hodges before the series keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year , and it must be giving them an extra 6 7 wins the pirates have made only 26 errors all season , 6 ahead of the second place dodgers error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive all time teams rube foster defeated sid fernandez 5 2 friday , and candelaria outshone seaver 3 2 saturday , in a game featuring some outstanding defense when nolan ryan and two relivers 6 hit the mets in another 3 2 win sunday , the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the 500 mark they had been unable to several times in the past month bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff , and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two run blast by ralph kiner for the pirates the mets' darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco , working his second inning , after mookie wilson pinch ran for gary carter at second with one out and a runner on first , lee mazilli was sent in to pinch hit the pirates countered with kent tekulve , placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second he slid hard into honus wagner , preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon tekulve allowed a hit , but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line , ending the inning tug mcgraw relieved randy myers , who entered to pitch the eighth , and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center , running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to win the pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 2 wins , and had moved to within 2 games of first place , with seven weeks to go san francisco at boswaukta \( august 3 5 \) another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule , as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just would n't tire in fact , reported manager john mcgraw , once this rough part of the schedule is over , maybe as early as this coming week , we may shift to a 4 man rotation again for a little while juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday , beating lew burdette and the braves 4 1 willie mays had all four r b i s on 3 hits rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest the braves' park had been a homer haven , but this took the cake , as the giants won a seesaw affair 16 13 willie mays had three homers , willie mccovey , eddie matthews , and don baylor had two , and hank aaron , ernie lombardi , biz mackey , and mel ott had one each the braves had collected 149 home runs going into sunday 's doubleheader , putting them on a pace for 223 , which would be 4 short of the national league record they were still a tad behind the '61 yankees' pace they had allowed over 120 , though vida blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth he allowed only a run in the sixth , but faltered in the seventh joe mcginnity earned the save in the doubleheader , the braves' hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game , but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won , 4 3 the giants took the second game , however , by a 6 2 score the homer by aaron was a magical 150 by the braves however , they fell to three game below 500 , making a comeback extremely unlikely san diego at cincinnati \( aug 3 5 \) randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this 3 game series , and the padres felt rather good with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game , the trade looked even better mcgriff 's batting average was even rising of course , the bench was very poor , and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield , but these were minor problems , since the pitching was holding up jones pitched a good game friday , and won 6 3 mcgriff launched two home runs mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday 5 4 was the final score tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a 3 3 tie through eight innings before departing the game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth paige had departed after 10 , and john franco hurled a scoreless inning tom browning was working his second scoreless inning , when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around thurm munson doubled both runners home , and the padres gamed a 5 3 win the three game sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds though the reds denied it , the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them brookangeles at houston \( august 3 5 \) another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game , opposite don drysdale normally , drysdale remarked , i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them i ca n't afford to with this team , though we have to get our own runners going we ca n't davis will get decked once the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six \( ! \) is primarily why he would be decked , but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season the hitting on this team is a little better , but the power is all doubles and triples still , carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend , as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park homers for those unaware of the nastness of the astros' park , they have a 23 foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs the foul poles are 355 feet from home plate , but the alleys are 400 feet away , with center field at 420 feet it 's as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates 'if i ca n't hit home runs , nobody will hit home runs' , remarked roy campanella the dodgers stole five bases friday , but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before for tonight , anyway , davis , jim wynn , and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings , according to the manager after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop , drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch he responded with a two run double , but wynn playing first for davis popped up , and the astros did n't score any more in that inning they did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3 2 deficit , and the astros wound up winning 6 4 they threatened to do even better the next game , as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at 6 a m before the game i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop , he explained how can we do that , pee wee reese wondered they 're going to be beating the ball down , so we 've got to be ready to throw on the run steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt , but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws we 'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time the plan almost worked mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings , but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third 3 2 astros was the final , with dave smith earning another save the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday , as nolan ryan walked five , three of whom scored in a 4 1 dodger win fernando valenzuela lost the second game 4 2 to don sutton , however , as the dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough we 're mostly a power team , remarked ron cey jackie and , when he plays , maury wills are our only real speed demons , though a couple other plays can do it now and then we 're sunk in a place like the astrodome i guess that 's why they 're so successful there indeed , it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome the 'stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts , giving them 230 on the season standings after these weekend series a l east team w l gb new york 68 42 cleveland 65 46 3 5 detroit 64 46 4 boston 64 47 4 5 baltimore 59 52 9

2	i contacted lotus about this problem today it has been reported previously and there is a fix apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame the work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding tab and use space to align the frame \( or use set frame where placed w no text wrap around \) unforutnately , once the page run on has occured you are hosed so the moral of the story is use only space characters to align equation frames hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this problem

' now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by god , according to romans that person is still saved by there faith but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to him \( i e does n't know him condemned \) so a lukewarm christian someone who knows and believes in god but does n't make any attempt to live by the bible now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone \( not what you do \) as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being 'spat out' can anyone help me , this really bothers me in christ , will

15	we also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been wrecked on our world because of christians who were certain they were following christ from captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict obedience to the gensis command to subdue the earth , to nazi 's who have justly punished the jews for the killing christ \( as well as the other progroms \) , the innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with you shall not allow a witch to live , the moslems who were killed in the crusades , the god fearing men destroyed by the inquistion the religious wars in spain , france , england , etc christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the instructions therein , was unquestionable there is much to grieve
5	again , poseted for a friend okay , i got such great response from my last question \( thanks , everyone \) , lets try again how can i tell if a colorcell is read only \? i want to use any read only cells that are already in my colormap once i start running out of allocatable cells , using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color once i determine if a cell is read only , i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor \( \) with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it does n't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read write to another application so far , the only way i 've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors , once my colormap is all full up it should error out if the cell is non shareable but life would be much easier if i could just detect the read only shareable stuff directly any ideas \?

2	i just purchased the norton desktop for windows , and i also have norton utilities when i installed ndw , it wanted to rem out the line that installed ep \( ep on \) and the command to invoke the image utility it replaced the image command with a new image command that invokes the version of image that came with ndw this makes sense , as presumably the image version with ndw is newer than the one with nu it did not , however , install smartcan in the autoexec now two questions 1 will nu use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked i e are the two version of image compatable \? 2 will erase protect use the info from smartcan , and vice versa \? i use both dos and windows , and i want to make sure that when i erase files in either environment , they are going to be protected from the experiments i have run , the two programs \( erase protect and smart erase \) do n't use each others info i currently have both ep and smartcan loading within my autoexec , and i do n't see any conflicts fyi norton desktop for windows version 2 2 norton util 's version 6
17	final solution for the gaza ghetto \? while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto , they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their high school by a palestinian freedom fighter be the ones who offer their help to the gazans perhaps it should be the families of the 18 israelis who were murdered last month by palestinian freedom fighters the jews in the warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to nazi gas chambers groups like hamas and the islamic jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all jews into the sea perhaps , we should persuade jewish people to help these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the co operative jews is that what you are counting on , elias the pity of murderers you say your mother was jewish how ashamed she must be of her son i am sorry , mrs davidsson

15	very interesting , but i also believe that you have presented a misleading argument christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate , rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand jesus christ 's message , and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims , rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the new testament with every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority , comes the inevitable fact that some \( many \? \) people will understand it in a distorted way , with inevitable consequences the bible 's message is that we are to love all people , and that all people are redeemable it preaches a message of repentance , and of giving unfortunately , all people have deceitful hearts , and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways this is also a fundamental christian doctrine one of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of western history i think that you will find many , many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were christian i am not saying this to justify the massacres that were , but i am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already consider the world without christianity i doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live , if it was n't for the peaceful doctrines of jesus christ perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion \( i wo n't name any here , though one comes to mind \) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power , greed and hatred please do n't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial , in love for others yours in christ , andrew mcveigh p s i believe that a line of questioning like you presented is , strangely enough , compatible with becoming a christian certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world , and especially christians i praise god for jesus christ , and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to god and be forgiven , time and time again

0	i 'll take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable i base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom \( so that their every act was contrary to their volition \) , almost all would want to complain therefore i take it that to assert or believe that freedom is not very valuable , when almost everyone can see that it is , is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on a rainy day i take this to be a candidate for an objective value , and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist

16	not so surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms , and that the police should not have discretion over who may and may not own firearms by the end of the clinton administration a lot of things will be screwed up hell , we 'll probably be just like england tough titty \? my how eloquent you are as for your claim , i think clinton has a big fight ahead of him if he thinks he 's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation he will sign the brady bill if it gets to his desk we will do whatever we can to either keep that from happening , or modify it such that it is acceptable to us sorry , that 's not possible and that 's why we wo n't give them up either legally or illegally , american 's will keep their firearms the number of unregistered weapons in new york city is in the millions there are n't even close to that number of violent criminals there if the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they belong instead of letting them out on early release hey , we can go into politics too if we feel like it i do n't believe this one bit snore like i take advice on the rkba from a brit no way you watch too much star trek actually , this is an understandable attitude from a brit you are a subject of the state not necessarily there are ways of resisting oppression without getting caught by the gov't the abstract criminal like the ones who killed a relative of mine while she was working in a carry out while undesirable , they are sometimes unavoidable if you do n't want to resist a criminal attack by all means do nothing i will \( a \) take my chances resisting violent attack , and \( b \) stand a better chance of being unharmed than someone who does nothing what a joke criminals want a disarmed population how can you keep criminals from preying on us after our best means of self defense is taken away \?

10	little i know what you mean ! i glow everytime ronnie 's out on the ice in fact , one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person is that i can key in on him instead of watching what i 'd probably be seeing on tv he does so many subtle things behind the play he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two way hockey that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards , for the most part , could n't and would n't play a lick of defense it 's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the pens you mention rick tocchet and he has certainly helped , and even ol' kjell has been steady but looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it would n't matter if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1 \) tom barrasso 2 \) ron francis 3 \) larry murphy \( i 'd love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso \)

2	while there are too many ps clones to count , some of which are quite poor , trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience three questions come to mid real quick for something like this q which version of adobe ps will we clone \? aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues , adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modifications upgrades fixes just as all other software vendors do the level 2 stuff may seem sound now , but i assure you , changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition this allows them to shift people to maintenance , as well as design efforts for level 3 q do we duplicate the bugs , or do we make it work correctly \? from the laserwriter to the laserjet 4 there have been bugs \( if i had a number to call at hp or adobe , they'ld have heard from me \) deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate q do we follow the red book , or do we follow someone 's implementation \? without a doubt , there are differences between the red book and adobe 's ps with level 2 many issues have been refined but the red book does leave big , big holes in the implementation specific stuff it would be nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of adobe 's ps do n't do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions q pscript drv \? having done a lot of ps clone testing myself , the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test files the primary source we use is genoa and having characterizes their 1992 ps ats files , \( 1300 of them \) over half are taken from pscript drv it may not ideal , but the ats files are what the printer vendors use i'm sure that adobe uses them too , but adobe 's output is by definition correct , even if its wrong yes , there are some very poor clones we 've seen them here at rastek \( a sub of genicom which has its own clone called geniscript \) some are poor for lack of design , some are poor because they followed the red book , and some are poor because the vendors do n't know what ps is

0	d d i just thought of another one , in the bible , so it 's definately not because of lack of religion the book of esther \( which i read the other day for other reasons \) describes the origin of pur'im , a jewish celbration of joy and peace the long and short of the story is that 75 , 000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about \( you could n't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice , peaceful solution \) 'course joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind i agree with bobby this far religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for that does n't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion , it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the universe the very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache contentsthan in any absolute truth , and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders the point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war whether these things are a part of religion , an unpleasant side effect or \( as bobby would have it \) the result of people switching between religion and atheism spontaneously , the results are the same religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of man 's history atheists , on the other hand \( preen , preen \) are typically not an ideological social caste , nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs the overuse of nazism and stalinism just show how true this is two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means anyone who cannot see the obvious namely that these were groups founded for reasons entirely their own , who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull is trying too hard basically , bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were not specifically fought over religion that he does not have many choices well , i'm off to key west where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butter dishes ciao

5	the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators , and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply unfortunately , the specification for xgrabkey does n't allow anymodifier to be combined with other modifiers , which is exactly what would be desired in this case ctrl any key q this is true for accelerators and mnemonics , which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs it 's not true for menu accelerators if you 're a motif implementor , i 'd suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics changed to support the feature i described above otherwise , change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user 's expectations , because menu accelerators are not the same thing as translations if you mean menu accelerator , no it 's not possible that 's according to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page i ca n't think of a reason why not there is a workaround for motif users in addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the xmpushbutton gadget , set an xtnaccelerators resource on the shell \( toplevel or application \) install the shell 's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with xtinstallallaccelerators \( shell , shell \) for example , applicationshell mainwindow menubar filecascade filepulldown openpushbutton exitpushbutton openpushbutton accelerator ctrl key o openpushbutton acceleratortext ctrl o exitpushbutton accelerator ctrl key q exitpushbutton acceleratortext ctrl q applicationshell accelerators override n ctrl key o performaction \( openpushbutton , armandactivate \) n ctrl key q performaction \( exitpushbutton , armandactivate \) you have to write and add the application action performaction , which you can implement by using xtnametowidget on the first argument and then xtcallactionproc with the rest of the arguments i tested out something similar to this to shorten development time , i used teleuse 's tuninstallaccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell , and i directly invoked the open and quit d actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me , but the more general approach i described above should work

1	in regards to fractal commpression , i have seen 2 fractal compressed movies they were both fairly impressive the first one was a 64 gray scale movie of casablanca , it was 1 3mb and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video it was a little grainy but not bad at all the second one i saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1 2mb i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore but unlike many other formats out there , you do end up losing resolution i do n't know what kind of software hardware was used for creating the movies i saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5 15 minutes per frame to generate but as i said above playback was 10 or more frames per second and how else could you put 11 minutes on one floppy disk \?

0	i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible , the quran , and science by maurice baucaille , a french surgeon it is not comprehensive , but , it is well researched i imagine your library has it or can get it for you through interlibrary loan i shall try to get hold of it \( when i have time to read of course \) in short , dr baucaille began investigating the bible because of pre ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies he assumed that some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by gone days so , he read what he could find in hebrew , greek , aramaic what he found was that the problems did n't go away , they got worse then , he decided to see if other religions had the same problems so , he picked up the holy qur'an \( in french \) and found similar prob lems , but not as many so , he applied the same logoic as he had with the bible he learned to read it in arabic the problems he had found with the french version went away in arabic he was unable to find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy qur'an , but , what he did find made sense with modern understanding so , he investigated the traditions \( the hadith \) to see what they had to say about science they were filled with science problems after all , they were contemporary narratives from a time which had , by pour standards , a primitive world view his conclusion was that , while he was impressed that what little the holy qur'an had to say about science was accurate , he was far more impressed that the holy qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions how would a man of 7th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy qur'an \( assuming he had authored it \) \? so in short the writer \( or writers \) of quran decided to stay away from science \( if you do not open your mouth , then you do n't put you foot into your mouth either \) but then if you say quran does not talk much about science , then one can not make claims \( like bobby does \) that you have great science in quran basically i want to say that none of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises so i am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims vinayak vinayak dutt e mail vdp mayo edu standard disclaimers apply

3	hello , i have a 486sx25 isa machine with pheonix bios currently i have 8 megabytes of ram installed via eight 1 mg simms on the motherboard ie both banks are full , and there is no space for more simms i am thinking of running os2 on my machine and possibly linux with x windows , and i know that more ram would be helpful however with simms , the only solution i can see is to sell my 8 megs for about 180 , and by 4 4mg simms for about 400 used apart from the fact that i ca n't afford the price right now , the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather avoid so my question is , do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 isa machine i have seen some being sold used for about 90 with 4 mg with space for another 4mg 's if these boards do work , how do they do it \? is a device driver needed , or will the bios pickup the extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board \? i know that the isa expansions slots are 16 bits and 486 simm memory is 32 bits , so probably all of this is just wishful thinking however any help is truly appreciated eric
7	ok , here 's what i understand the sl sl1 sl2 sw1 sw2 was meant to compete with the following cars honda civic toyota tercel \( sl , sl1 \) toyota corolla \( sl1 , sl2 \) nissan sentra mazda 323 protoge' subaru loyale impreza isuzu stylus geo prizm ford escort mercury tracer mistubishi mirage plymouth dodge colt their core competition is the civic , corolla , and sentra most of the other models are in the same class , but are n't the first cars you would think of i threw in the escort tracer because it has a good amount of japanese technology and has similar reliability stats i did n't include domestic small cars such as the cavalier , sunbird , shadow , sundance , tempo , and topaz , since i think saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of japanese roots the sc1 sc2 was meant to compete against the following cars toyota paseo honda civic si civic coupes del sol si nissan nx1600 nx2000 mazda mx 3 isuzu impulse geo storm ford escort gt if you look at the prices of these cars , they 're more expensive than they 're 4 door counterparts the is good reason for this it is a more upscale and trend driven market even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms , their interior , etc is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices here are some of the platform derivations i can think of tercel paseo sentra nx1600 nx2000 civic del sol 323 mx 3 \( not sure on this one \) stylus impulse storm to illustrate , a tercel starts at around 8000 , while the paseo starts at around 11 , 000 even a 4 door tercel will cost less than a 2 door paseo now , you might be saying that the tercel does n't offer the power that some 4 doors offer what i mean is that there is no 4 dr tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative let 's take another example the isuzu stylus xs and impulse xs storm gsi both have the same powerplants \( a 1 6l 140hp engine \) , but the smaller 2 dr coupes are generally more expensive again , this is because the two door sport coupe market is a more fashion oriented and trend setting segment people are willing to pay more money for this type of car in short , even though the sc1 sc2 may be smaller , hence less car , it 's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan \( sl1 sl2 \) version i hope this clears things up a bit

announce newsgroup patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which x11 is available they are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp sources x some source re sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of x11 people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server it now has 23 patches for x11r5 3 93 send to xstuff expo lcs mit edu the subject line send fixes where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch here are a few complications 1 \) fix 5 is in four parts you need to request 5a , 5b , 5c and 5d separately 2 \) the file sungx uu , which was part of an earlier patch , was re released with patch 7 note the file does n't work with solaris 3 \) fix 8 is in two parts 8a and 8b 4 \) fix 13 is in three parts 13a , 13b , and 13c 5 \) fix 16 is in two parts 16a and 16b 6 \) fix 18 replaces the r5fix test1 for the x test suite , which previously was optional 7 \) fix 19 also needs pexlib tar z , which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for pexlib uu 1234 8 \) fix 22 is in 9 parts , 22a through 22i subject 59 \) what is the xstuff mail archive \? the xstuff server is a mail response program that means that you mail it a request , and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything , so you can have several different commands in a single message \( unless you ask for help \) the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories each directory has an index , and each subdirectory has an index the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories , and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it 1 \) the command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file 2 \) if your message contains a line whose first word is index , then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories , then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index for example , you can say send index fixes \( or index fixes \) a message that requests an index cannot request data 3 \) if your message contains a line whose first word is send , then the xstuff server will send you the item \( s \) named on the rest of the line to name an item , you give its directory and its name for example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the day 's quota , then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day whenever the mailer is run to send its day 's quota , it sends the requests out shortest first 4 \) some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses if you use such a mailer , you wo n't get any response if you happen to know an explicit path , you can include a line like path foo bar bitnet mitvma mit edu or path bar ! foo ! frotz in the body of your message , and the daemon will use it the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff expo lcs mit edu if your mailer deals in ! notation , try sending to someplace !

15	there is another way to view this the true celebration is easter , the resurrection of our lord this has been true from the foundation of the world pagan practices are then either 1 foreshadowings of the true celebration of the resurrection , in which dim light was shone forth so that people would recognize the full truth when it was manifested , or 2 satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not recognize the truth when it was manifested i do n't believe the second argument , because i believe in the power of the resurrection , the fulfillment of the incarnation , and our hope earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the resurrection as paul states , we see through a glass darkly so do others it serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass the foreshadowings are not perfect so what \? our understnding of god is today imperfect , for we are not yet perfected theosis is not a gift such that wham , we 're perfect larry overacker \( llo shell com \)

10	wales conference , adams division , semifinal i'm hoping for a fuhr miracle , but i agree that boston will likely win the series goaltending is about equal , top offensive players are about equal \( mogilny lafontaine vs oates juneau \) , but buffalo has no answer to neely \( not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw , in fact he 's one of my favourites even though he 's a damn bruin \) \) and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six agreed here but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me , or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy \? go habs ! ! final i ca n't predict a montreal victory because i 've been watching them play for 6 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players , especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b 's 5 2 but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roy 's at the same time , i ca n't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss , so i 'll just say i will not be putting money on this series \) agreed ny does n't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught , independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five , which is credit to ny agreed here too , but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team , and washington has done poorly against the division this year i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i do n't think it will go six either maybe five if pittsburgh plays boston , imo they win in likely five , possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal , i think it will go to seven , and once again i wo n't be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season chicago will win , but i think in at least six chicago is not that good , imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties very true the leafs have much to be proud of , but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six , maybe even seven it will be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes , i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they do n't use their size at all , which may explain why they get hammered 8 1 by a team chasing them \( calgary \) winnipeg in six this is also tough for me to call , because i have n't seen the smythe enough i do n't think roberts will be well enough to figure in , coffey is a non issue , who cares what carson has done before , and never underestimate gretzky la in six if it is these two , calgary will not need six games but i think it will be la winnipeg anyway , and la in seven , because of home ice wow , must 've been tough to go against your team but let 's see , i picked la detroit detroit will win , probably in six if pittsburgh plays detroit , it will go longer than five , and i would n't bet against the wings they are very strong , imo , and nobody knows how strong because they 've been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose , though , i 'd have to take the penguins a side note vlad , last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from the age difference , there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i'm not asking for flames , either , btw i 've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he 's a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively \( give teemu an edge \) , gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on , esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best all round players in the nhl
19	no there are two problems here \( 1 \) peter died two millenia ago the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust if he were alive today and i could question him , then this might lend credibility to your claims \( but probably not much , because after all , i 've heard people claim with all sincerity that they 've spoken with elvis recently \) but after his death , peter 's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries , and i find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere did n't decide to change the wording of something to make it \( in his opinion \) a little easier to understand \( 2 \) even if peter did witness the miracles of jesus two millenia ago , that does n't mean that your deity is what the bible says it is \( god might just be satan , trying to convince everyone that he 's a nice guy \) , or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today nice try , but it just is n't enough to convince me , especially since your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way i 've observed the world to work please find something more compelling

15	i 'd just like to repeat and emphasize that because someone else is trying to make you feel horrible and worthless does not mean that you should feel that way , although that 's easier to say than believe sometimes remember , god made you and loves you , so he must think you 're something special \( excuse the trite language here \) also , the bully may just be someone who is mean for no reason not out of intentional mental torture has anyone else been harassed \? maybe they 're just not talking about it i would have emailed but my reactions were n't fast enough and the post i'm responding to did n't include your address just take courage and remember that all of us on the net are rooting for you

5	if i understand your problem correctly , you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app specific code draws xlib graphics on the window it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using xsendevent and specifying a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure , generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects , you can use xcreateregion to create a region , xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygons to the region , and then either use the region to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look hope it helps brian dealy 301 572 8267 it not knowing where it 's at dealy kong gsfc nasa gov that 's important , it 's knowing ! uunet ! dftsrv ! kong ! dealy where it 's not at b dylan

17	henrik country turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gimme a break capital letters , or not , the above is pure nonsense it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities again , armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves what do want them to do lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them bm while hoping that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment , bm will you \? armenia does n't need anyone to drag her into the conflict , it bm is a part of it armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhi armenians henrik the karabakhi armenians who have lived in their homeland for 3000 henrik years \( cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin \) are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression bm huh \? you did n't expect azeri 's to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders \? well , history is sad remember , those are relocated azeris into the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime henrik at last , i hope that the u s insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again bm you 're not playing with a full deck , are you \? where would turkey invade \? it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped into armenia if she could bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s c g in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun \? absolutely not ! i am merely trying to emphasize that in many cases , history repeats itself bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene , what she wishes bm she had , however , is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table that 's hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns so , let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey wants a peaceful end to this conflict not ! ! i will believe it when i see it now , as far as attacking , what do you do when you see a gun pointing to your head \? do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef \( fat chance \) \? do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku \? all the barberian acts especially against mothers and their children i mean burning people alive ! bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that 's bm going to cause incessant skirmishes armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic they are not asking much they simply want to get back what was taken away from them and given to azeris by stalin bm think of 10 or 20 years down the line both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out these people will be neighbors , would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal \? do n't get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the conflict but until azeris realize that , the armenians in karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora , keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future again , you are taking different turns armenia has no intension to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves until a solution is set bm it 's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled the armenians bm in armenia and n k will be there , with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors , for maybe 3000 years more the sooner there 's peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else i 'd push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps lock and spreading bm inflammatory half truths
14	in spite of my great respect for the people you speak of , i think their cost estimates are a bit over optimistic if nothing else , a working ssto is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base it therefore seems that ssto development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development that puts it in the 3g to 5g range true it and the contest would result in a much larger market but i do n't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the risks involved if you could gurantee the ssto costs and gurantee that it captures 100 of the available launch market , then i think you could do it allen

13	i think we agree on much however the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard kuhn lakatos feyerabend view of progress and rationality in science since i 've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past , i wo n't go into them again now what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression \( and you may not in fact hold this view \) that the common \( perhaps even the correct \) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds it further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward \( and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs \) by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science \( though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mystery if experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication this is what leads one \( ala feyerabend \) to an anything goes view \) true , the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it is not anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one 's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science

13	aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide , so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol , which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde the amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise , since you 're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time in studies involving administration of high doses of the additive , blood methanol levels were undetectable methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings , say 5ml and above this is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid , two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney , because at such high doses the body 's detoxification system is overwhelmed interestingly , one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol vodka or an equivalent that 's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver if the methanol stays as methanol and is n't metabolized to formaldehyde , it is actually relatively non toxic

18	well , i do n't think your query was exactly polite , but i will try to give you a polite responce something atypical of the net , but here it goes black is a descriptive adjective that describes mr king from many of the newspaper , radio , and tv news reports i have seen , this adjective is commonly in front of his name i have never seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner i did not say that mr king was a no good black ! i do not know mr king and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect i used it purely as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many \( most \) news people have used it in the past the entire second trial was about race , ted i do n't feel compelled to discuss mr king 's racial background , but had mr king been white there would not have been a second trial you probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white , but that is an extremely difficult call to make it is possible the case , but not definately i still think your actions are crap , ted they are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non derogenory manner would you have been happier if i had used 'african american' \? if so , then you really are lost in the world of pc you have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked , and i wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that i am not worthy of posting

15	responding to the moderator yes , i agree what i'm trying to point out is that , in matters of faith \( i e tenets which are not logically persuasive \) , one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through , for instance , personal revelation and its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others and i do n't think that its arrogant , persay , to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself where i think the conflict arises is in assuming that , where disagreements on beliefs arise , all others must have been given the same truth , and that god must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest that they are rejecting something they know to be truth because it is inconvenient for them , or because they wish to spurn god i would say that this is equivalent to assuming that all truths one holds are universal and absolute and the problem i see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with god this does not mean there is no absolute truth just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or revealed that truth comments , criticism welcome ken alvin ucsu colorado edu

15	i strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation that 's because truth may be absolute , but it may not be obvious like so many things , the truth is always subject to misinterpretation i strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here , which is why i deign from commenting much further now hold it i never said that christians cannot be arrogant indeed , as many other christians on src have stressed before , this is a trap that christians must always be wary about however , this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the bible , you are necessarily being arrogant a christian can believe that the word of god is absolute , but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone not quite you say that according to my stance , we cannot reliably determine what is true that is not what i said i say that as fallible human beings , we cannot discern the truth with 100 certainty the distinction is subtle yet important when a scientist performs an experiment , he can claim that his results are reliable , without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made in other words , he can admit that he could be mistaken , without sacrificing his convictions nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100 certainty throughout the centuries , philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered , cogito , ergo sum , yet we have not advanced much beyond that do you believe that other people aside from you exist \? do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists \? if so , can you be absolutely certain about that \? are you sure it is not some grand illusion \? of course , you have no such assurance this does not mean , however , that for all practical purposes , you can be certain that they exist so it is with christianity the most mature christians i know have deep convictions about absolute morality , yet they acknowledge that there is a non zero probability that they are wrong this does not , however , mean that they should \( or do \) abandon these absolutes as i said , we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct this does not mean that we cannot be certain enough , in light of the evidence , to render all doubts unreasonable

18	in order of your questions , i oppose it , i oppose it , i oppose it and \( huh \? wha \? where did that topic come from and what 's it got to do with the discussion at hand \? \) when i was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people \( and yes , i do consider laws which allow mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict 's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category \) , the category of classes i had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion classes based upon race , gender , ethnicity , religion , sexual orientation , etc having you ask about classes based upon one 's profession rather than one 's personal characteristics caught me off guard , and i had to think out the question from scratch what i finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others , and that would be anathema to the underlying american concept of equal treatment under the law last year , when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty plus crimes , including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that aura of deterrence , critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher , when the latter arguably provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society this was an emotionally compelling argument , but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their contribution to society i view that doctrine as being both \( a \) personally repugnant and \( b \) repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment accordingly , i believe that there should be no laws which give any profession based class of people special protection \( via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class \) , not even police officers , federal officers or high ranking members of the executive branch of the federal government

15	as our local religion christian bbs group seems moribund , i'm posting here on one of the sundays just before easter i went to church the sermon was based on a story in the book of joshua \( the one about joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take \) what i particularly remember , because of having heard part of a cbc radio documentary on bosnia , was that the rahab \( the woman who sheltered the spies \) said that the people were melting in fear what with having heard that cbc radio documentary and knowing that the muslims in bosnia were losing the war , i felt uncomfortable after all , the serbs are driving non christians out on the other hand , ministers do say that the bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society anyhow members of that church are involved in out of country missionary work also , the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing christ to the nonreligious people of our area the next sunday , the sermon was about joshua 6 \( where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab , who had sheltered the spies \) with those reports about bosnia in my mind , i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre \( the one in joshua \) was right but what really bothered me was that , if i was going to try taking christianity seriously , i should n't be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in bosnia certainly , my sympathies should n't be with the moslims considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who , under turkish rule , converted to islam could the serbs be doing god 's work \?

10	the last name is niedermayer , as in new jersey 's scott 's last name , because \( you guessed it \) they are brothers but rob niedermayer is a center , not a defenseman i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya they are n't saying much , but they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov , along with kariya chris pronger 's name has also been mentioned my guess is that they 'll take niedermayer they may take pronger , except that they already have too many defensive prospects
14	a what about positional uncertainties in s l 1993e \? i assume we know where and what galileo is doing within a few meters but without the hga , do n't we have to have some pretty good ideas , of where to look before imaging \? if the hga was working , they could slew around in near real time \( less speed of light delay \) but when they were imaging toutatis \? \? \? \? did n't someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images \? also , i imagine s l 1993e will be mostly a visual image so how will that affect the other imaging missions with the lga , there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth it may be premature to hope for answers , but i thought i 'd throw it on the floor

14	actually , hiten was n't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all , so it indeed did n't have much fuel on hand the lunar orbit mission was an afterthought , after hagoromo \( a tiny subsatellite deployed by hiten during a lunar flyby \) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit could n't be positively confirmed it should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages it takes a long time , and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit , you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel , although it is reduced from what you 'd need for the brute force approach

17	from center for policy research cpr subject symbiotics zionism antisemitism zionism and the holocaust by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without anti semitism is impossible zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti semitism , namely that jews cannot live with non jews the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942 , its roots were firmly placed in the 19th century jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe when the hopes for liberation through bourgeois democratic change were dashed , other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence the socialist bund , a mass movement with enormous following , had to contend with opposition from a new and small , almost insignificant opponent , the political zionists in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europe 's workers , the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state historically , nothing is inevitable , all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle history can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen , other routes become barred because of that choice , movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews , it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd reich the zionist federation of germany \( zvfd \) , an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews , was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin , and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period from a marginal position , the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them all of a sudden they attained political power , power based not on representation , but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the 'jewish problem' their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian , marginal organisation in germany \( and some other countries in europe \) into a real option to be considered by german jews the best example of this was the 'transfer agreement' of 1934 immediately after the nazi takeover in 1933 , jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out , the campaign would collapse this problem was solved by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi party as early as 21 june 1933 , outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race , nation , and the nature of the 'jewish problem' , and it offered to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways is in essence unzionist , because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime , the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott the main public act was the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of 1934 in essence , the agreement was designed to get germany 's jews out of the country and into mandate palestine it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country , through a transfer of german goods to palestine this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination the zionist organisation was the acting agent , through its financial organisations this agreement operated on a number of fronts 'helping' jews to leave the country , breaking the ring of the boycott , exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine , and last but not least , enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies , the jews after all , they argued , the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them after news of the agreement broke , the boycott was doomed if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis , and import their goods , who could argue for a boycott \? this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary baron von mildenstein , the first head of the jewish department of the ss , later followed by eichmann , was invited to travel to palestine this he did in early 1933 , in the company of a zionist leader , kurt tuchler having spent six months in palestine , he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the 'new jew' of zionism , a jew nazis could accept and understand this little known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism , between the new regime and the zvfd , a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances , even after the nature of the final solution became clear in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is post ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust , by s b beth zvi in the case of the kastner episode , around which jim allen 's play perdition is based , even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist it occured near the end of the war the ussr had advanced almost up to germany italy and the african bases had been lost the nazis were on the run , with a number of key countries , such as rumania , leaving the axis a second front was a matter of months away , as the western allies prepared their forces in the midst of all this we find eichmann , the master bureaucrat of industrial murder , setting up his hz in occupied budapest , after the german takeover of the country in april 1944 his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership , and to appoint zionist federation members , headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities why they did this is not difficult to see as opposed to poland , where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population , the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community the middle class was mainly jewish , the jews were mainly middle class they enjoyed freedom of travel , served in the hungarian \( fascist \) army in fronline units , as officers and soldiers , their names were hungarian how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated \? the task was not easy , there were a million jews in hungary , most of them resident , the rest being refugees from other countries many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere , and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials like elsewhere , the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members without their help the ss , with 19 officers and less than 90 men , plus a few hundred hungarian police , could not have collected and controlled a million jews , when they did not even know their whereabouts kastner and the others were left under no illusions eichmann told joel brand , one of the members of kastner 's committee , that he intended to send all hungary 's jews to auschwitz , before he even started the expulsions ! he told them clearly that all these jews will die , 12 , 000 a day , unless certain conditions were met the committee faced a simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate , \( with neutral rumania , where many could escape , being in most cases a few hours away \) or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process what would not have been believed when coming from the ss , sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership thus it is , that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death , assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps to be sure , there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of 'prominents' which eichmann promised to kastner a promise he kept to the last detail for eichmann it was a bargain allowing 1 , 680 jews to survive , as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located , not to say murdered , without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there , but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration , like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs , palgi and senesh , and persuaded them to give themselves up , so as not to disrupt his operations at no point during his trial or elsewhere , did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews

15	one of the things i find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity being brought up in a christian household , i often wondered if there was god the father , where was the mother \? everyone i know who has a father usually as a mother it just seemed rather unbalanced to me fortunately , my own personal theology , which will probably not fall into line with a lot others , recognized god as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders , as being both a masculine and feminine force it provides a sense of balance i find sorely lacking in most theologies , a lack which i think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other

10	as the sharks' season came to a close tonight , i will start a series of posts , trying to revisit the players , the trades , the moves , etc , that went through for the sharks for the past season if you are uninterested , since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings , you can kill them i will first try to evaluate how the players did these ratings , of course , are subject to my own biases , but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and or did not play for another nhl team this season thus , then , let 's go to the goaltenders 1 brian hayward season 11th acquired '91 92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade p \( d \) it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end , a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies \( with patrick roy , in '87 , '88 , and '89 \) it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade \( and skip the letter grading \) , but he had simply been awful on ice this year , save for a bright spot or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would not be any more than the 3rd string goalie but hayward was a classy individual , who also figured in on the sharks' first ever victory , the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires , the fans will remember what a good guy he was 30 jeff hackett season 3rd acquired '91 92 , from n y islanders in expansion draft grade c hackett , after \( deservedly \) winning the team mvp honors last season , simply wasted the year other than a few good spots \( 57 saves against los angeles , almost shutout against tampa bay , etc \) , hackett , finishing with 85 6 save percentage and a 5 28 gaa , watched his status go from the team 's 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season he was expected , early , to carry the team along instead , he apparently became frustrated , but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor , but upon return , he simply was n't up to the task he may not return next year 31 wade flaherty season 1st \( still eligible as rookie \) acquired '91 92 , signed as undrafted free agent grade i \( a \) it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone , thus the incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get \( against the calgary flames \) , flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods he started the season poorly in kansas city , but finished strong , prompting the blades' owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year , he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs , picking up all star honors along with irbe now it 's time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year , because with prospects dan ryder , trevor robins , and scott cashman coming along , if he does n't make it next year , he may not ever 32 arturs irbe season 1st acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he 's a bona fide nhl goaltender , perhaps a bona fide 1 goaltender he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had , getting the team 's first ever shut out against the los angeles kings on december 26 he has been fearless in and out of the net , aggressively playing the puck and making passes , reminding people of a young ron hextall \( except , of course , the goonism \) yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season , irbe 's the key , as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts
17	the latest israeli proposal , first proposed in february of 1992 , contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza , the palestinians , implemented by negotiations it states that israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status is agreed upon israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the interim self government arrangements \( isga \) the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories under israeli military administration the arrangements will not have a territorial application , nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects external , internal and for the maintenance of public order the organs of the isga will be of an administrative functional nature the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration , justice , personnel , agriculture , education , business , tourism , labor and social welfare , local police , local transportation and communications , municipal affairs and religious affairs several question do come to mind concerning the success we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process these arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any palestinian interim self control without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability , can israel reasonably put forward \( at later points in the negotiating process \) more relaxed proposals for this interim period \? how should proposals \( from either side \) be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above \? how can israeli worries , and desire for some interim control , be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian self governing entity \? tim
12	thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exar 's xr 2240 timer counter chip it is stable down to 50 c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultra long time delay \( up to several years depending on the rc time constant \) in this application , they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration , the output is high when the system is reset when triggered , the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65 , 536 x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to 256 x r x c to 65 , 536 x r x c in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is , the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uf timing cap and a 391k resistor for 39 1 seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of 2 , 562 , 457 6 seconds between timing cycles \( 39 1 x 65 , 536 or about 29 days ! \) of course , that 's much more than i need \( 14 days \) but the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker' after the first 14 days and it trips , it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow \( as an insulator \) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea \) this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway , i ordered the xr 2240 's to see what i can do with them should be interesting \( as long as i'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off \) thanks again everyone

13	this is a lovely area for anecdotes , but i am sure you are on to something as a physician , i almost never get sick usually , when something horrendous is going around , i either do n't get it at all or get a very mild case when i do get really sick , it is always something unusual this was not the situation when i was in medical school , particularly on pediatrics i never had younger siblings myself , and when i went on the pediatric wards i suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness , and i had a temp of 104 when i took the final exam ! i think what happens is that during training , and beyond , we are constantly exposed to new things , and we have the usual reactions to them , so that later on , when challenged with something , it is more likely a re exposure for us , so we deal with it well and get a mild illness i do n't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way also , do n't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home , and we carry a lot of that around

18	you misunderstand i'm not trying to prove a cause for anything merely pointing out that ted 's assertion that the blip in revenues was caused by selling to avoid the tax ca n't be proven not disputed it works for any situation if you believe the market is going up , do n't sell if believe it 's not , sell but then you 'd be selling anyways , would n't you \? so where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out \? there is n't any ted 's saying that the increase over the previous year is proof of that proposition , but i'm saying you ca n't know that the trend of increasing capital gains revenues would n't account for a lot of that increase 1986 was the height of the housing boom , remember people were trading up like mad indeed

13	hmmm the last time i got stung by a bee i experienced the same reaction the first poster 's brother did we went off to the doctor to see if i should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it 's normal size \( and itched ! ! ! ow ! \) he basically said i should n't this time , but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to , but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time i go into anaphylactic shock admittedly this was many years ago when i was young since then i just make sure i do n't get stung i also should carry a bee sting kit with me , but i do n't this is n't scientific or proof , but this would lead me to believe it 's not a different reaction , just a different degree of reaction allergies work that way people have various reactions sort of like diabetes , some people can get by with just monitoring their diet , others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly i think msg is probably similar some people have allergic reactions to it some people are allergic to fermented things and ca n't use soy sauce but the chinese have been using it for centuries that does n't necessarily mean that it 's safe for everyone

16	it was around 1969 in the shenandoah valley near woodstock , virginia me , my wife , a friend , his wife , and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally desolate mountain area all of a sudden , large rocks began raining down on us looking up , we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks from what was an obvious stash they were a couple hundred feet above us meanwhile , the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the punks were shrieking with laughter me and my friend yelled for them to knock it off they responded that we should get f ed ! me and my friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above their heads they ran with no more 3 5 pound rocks coming at our heads , we proceeded on our journey sorry , but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more violent level than we were already experiencing i guess we should have tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society had instilled in them and was driving them to do such things guess that 's a cross i 'll have to bear

9	i wondered the same thing when he first mentioned it , i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over and then in the examples from other years , he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded so \( since stats never lie \) \) , i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that , normally , they would not have had there not been expansion

13	i do not know a lot about this , except from seeing one patient with kartagener 's syndrome , which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus , bronchiectasis , and chronic infections situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong side of the body , and can be complete or partial it is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion , so that in absence of this , laterality can be random people with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools , because of their rarity , and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they ca n't find the patient 's heart sounds \( because they 're on the wrong side \) according to harrison 's , immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive , which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected but there may be much more current information on this , and as usual in medicine , we may be talking about more than one conditiion i would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist , of which there is probably one at ncsu

5	as applied to servers , the first three are fuzzy terms multi headed tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors , sometimes even multiple screens even if they 're multiplexed onto the same monitor \( eg , a sun with a cg4 display \) multi screen and multi display would , if taken strictly , mean different things , but since the strict meaning of multi display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers , when it 's used it probably refers to the same thing multi screen would a system that provides multiple screens zaphod is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at most 255 screens i know of no server that handles multiple displays on a single invocation , unless possibly my kludges to the r4 server can be looked upon as such on a tcp based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 displays per machine , but this is not a limitation inherent to x what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation \( probably the mit one \) if it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to x , the author of the article had no business writing about x der mouse

2	gawd , i love windows \) you 'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired you 're not stupid smartdrive caches things , and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment a reasonably accurate prediction here 's a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry , the fat chain , and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper , a sheet of graph paper , and a stack of 3x5 cards the directory entry \( notebook paper \) holds the file name , actual size , and first cluster number it also holds some other information that 's not important right now the file allocation table \( fat \) chain \( graph paper \) tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero , the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number , it is either the last piece of a file or a bad \( unuseable \) spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area \( 3x5 cards \) is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each \( in your case , one cluster is 2048 bytes \) as a cluster is filled , another is allocated to read a file , you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next , look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally , these numbers are usually sequential , but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading , one cluster at a time , as you walk this chain through the fat , until you hit the marker which says it 's the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it does n't have any intelligence , so you have to double check anything it fixes now let 's do a bit of a post mortem all of these files have sizes \( according to the fat \) which do n't match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size \( in other words , the directory entry for cvpic exe may say the file is 64 , 877 bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of 43 clusters attached to it \( my numbers , obviously , are made up \) \) disk space was found which is allocated in the fat , but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files \( file0000 chk through file0223 chk \) and rename or discard them or , if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files , then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously , one of them \( at least \) must be wrong it 's interesting to note that c 386spart par is your windows swap file to fix this , you should copy each cross linked file to a new name this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the cross linked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck \( hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top \) your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case , the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this , but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon vpnet chi il us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec 3rd !

13	i would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors \( of the squeaky clean , traditional crew cut , talk to the ama before starting any treatment , kind \) who recommend treatments that , though accepted , may not be necessary for the patient at the time and all for making a quick buck i would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the u s is significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color in fact , i 'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession the ama and the boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search and destroy missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional accepted medicine cannot help now to make a general comment on many recent posts lately i 've seen the word quack bandied about recklessly when a doctor or doctor wanna be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner , all he she has to do is say quack quack and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience what do they teach you in medical school how to throw your authority around \? let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming from any medical doctor \( or wanna be \) , where competency is expected , is real scary but what do i know , i 've already been diagnosed by the sci med gods in this newsgroup as being 'anal retentive' , and 'psychotic' i look forward to more net diagnoses hey , they 're free jon quacks 'r us noring \( p s , may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories , such as the yeast theory , should create your own moderated group you can call it sci med traditional moderated or sci med ama approved , so you can keep anal retentives like me out of it \) charter member infj club

1	a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he is n't in the position to post this himself , he asked me to post it for him , but to leave his name out so here it comes cview has quite a number of bugs the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying , but not the most dangerous as far as i can determine , it has to do with the temp files that cview creates cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory the problem you mention occurs \( as far as i can tell \) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview does n't check properly for this situation as cview decodes a jpeg , it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information then , for 8 bit displays , it does the dithering , again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information while it is writing this second file , it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data , it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again \( it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature , even when this feature is not enabled \) the result of this process is the following 1 \) if it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file , all you ever see is as much data as it has room for , and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes reads are n't performed 2 \) if it has enough room for the 24 bit data , but runs out of room for the 8 bit data , you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card however , then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen \( for whatever reason it does this \) one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk this is just a guess , but probably fairly accurate at least the general idea is on track i think , although i have probably made errors in details about file i o etc the way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space the temp files for large jpeg 's \( 1200x900 and bigger \) can be very large \( 3 meg 1 meg \) on some of the largest i have needed in excess of 6 meg free disk space cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy , and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy , then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory \( and fat table \? i ca n't remember \) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy , thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious , possibly unrevcoverable way so be careful ! it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this on the other hand , when choosing files in the open files menu , cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi lighter square incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info and really , how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing \?
11	it seems to me that all discussions about clipper security are almost irrelevant if i cannot choose the key , but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry , the security of the whole universe of users is as good \( or as bad \) as the security of vlsi technologies inc it is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains all the keys ever manufactured after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that will ever be manufactured the key depositories can be as secure and incorruptible as they wish to be , nobody cares anyway \( now if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of vti , att and others are impenetrable \( remember the chips have to ship with the key you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually \) i 'd be a bit happier but do we really believe that the various governments \( including ours \) wo n't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured \? did i miss something here \? my own opinions , quite obviously
15	i have a hard time understanding this attitude if the gospels are the least bit accurate , then there can be little doubt that jesus belived hell was a reality as a teacher , what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there \? to warn them ! it would , however , be rather cruel and or sadistic to believe that such a place exists and then remain quiet about it the only scenario i can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if jesus knew there was no such place as hell , and spoke about it anyway , just to scare people unless you would accuse jesus of this , i would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response is when you perceive someone to be in danger
11	the key question is whether non clipper encryption will be made illegal the clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that americans have the right to clipper encryption , but not to unbreakable encryption this implies that , ultimately , non clipper strong encryption must become illegal \( as an aside , is n't the language here jarring \? all this talk about harmonious balance when they 're talking about taking away people 's right to communications privacy \? \) although the article emphasizes voice communication , data and mail encryption is mentioned as well it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning 's proposals are coming true if the government continues on this course , i imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal encryption programs for disk files and email , as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications , will be distributed only through the underground people will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy it 's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

14	ed campion headquarters , washington , d c april 23 , 1993 \( phone 202 358 1780 \) kyle herring johnson space center , houston \( phone 713 483 5111 \) release 93 76 hubble telescope servicing mission scheduled for eleven days the december flight of endeavour on space shuttle mission sts 61 to service the hubble space telescope \( hst \) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two , if needed the decision to schedule five extravehicular activities , or evas , was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training , maneuver times required using the shuttle 's robot arm based on software simulations and actual eva tasks on previous missions basically what we 've done by going to five evas rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics , or unknowns , of spacewalks , mission director randy brinkley said it improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real time situations in laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks , officials have determined that changing out the gyros , solar arrays and the wide field planetary camera \( wf pc \) and installing the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement \( costar \) are priority objectives during the mission when we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks , highest through lowest priority , and recognizing that the major tasks gyros , solar arrays , wf pc and costar would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk , five evas were deemed appropriate , said milt heflin , lead flight director for the mission while the five spacewalks will be unprecedented , the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two , three or four evas we have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five evas , heflin said in planning for all space shuttle missions , it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the mission control center , called joint integrated simulations , lasting between 10 and 36 hours in addition , many stand alone underwater training runs will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission also , lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the sts 61 crew in its training techniques endeavour 's june flight and discovery 's july mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the hst mission the evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the johnson space center , houston , and the marshall space flight center , huntsville , ala also , the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps , the flight controllers and trainers designed to be serviced by a space shuttle crew , hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures the telescope was launched aboard discovery in april 1990 at that time the nasa mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to hst in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary

17	tell me tim , what are these guerillas doing wrong \? assuming that they are using civilians for cover , are they not killing soldiers in their country \? if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel , is it not working \? why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages \? why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone \? you see , there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it does n't make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then , imho , it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks no , i am not basil i think basil is a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes basil is a person that i would gladly call a friend he is , however , not me nor am i lebanese , as some seem to suspect tim , you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi , his wife , and young son of course , if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they would n't make the lebanese so mad as to do that furthermore , with hezbollah subsequently disarmed , it would not be possible tim , when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border \? not lately , eh \? israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of its borders , the presence of syrian troops in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory \( not on israeli troops in lebanon , however please note the distinction \) in the past two years i disagree , basil has always seemed to me to be a cool headed person , slow to anger \( certainly more so than i \) what is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of the israeli guns if only the israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were reversed perhaps they would moderate their retaliation

16	so , like , what do you do during those six months to be active \? my town has a similar requirement , and it 's rather stupid before you can buy a handgun , you have to be an active member of a gun club well , how active can you be without a gun , chief \? most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing if it could n't be abused by the government but every time this is proposed , there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase even if you are perfectly qualified to own a gun and we oppose this since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the us is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners , i 'd think twice before using this analogy besides , the problem is criminal use of guns , not accidents \( there are about 500 , 000 criminal uses of guns in the us every year but only 1 , 400 accidents \) i do n't think it 's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he gets one just like the check , most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses if they could n't be abused by the government but they already have ! one state does n't hold the courses , another does n't fund them , a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections is this fair \? and how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets \? how many are borrowed , stolen , smuggled , bought on the black market \? some states allow only open carry some allow only concealed carry some allow both some allow both , but require licenses for concealed carry all you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good , then state legislators someplace are doing exactly the wrong thing which means that they really do n't have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences a bad way to govern \( hot livered i love that expression here , we say hot headed \) typically , the only criminals who can affect the rights of all the other people are criminals in government offices the rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time , and they do this during the commission of a crime possession of a gun by someone hurts no one else it is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs of course , it is a crime for a felon or ex felon to possess a gun , but we do n't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre felons waiting to commit crimes i do n't understand this sentence life is n't fair i should n't need a fire extinguisher either , or flood and theft insurance , or to lock the doors of my house and car but pining for a better world wo n't do anything to address what i have to do to live in this one none of ours , i'm sure frankly , i'm not sure i know what good a driver 's license does anyone , either the people who drive safely never use it , and the people who drive drunk , drive without it ! however , a car is a good tool , but not one that protects my right to life i rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely the question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally it 's whether or not you think that all people should be forced to do as you do i do n't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun i do have a problem with someone who says i should be prevented from owning one , too

12	i want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying adcom seperates i have heard from alot of people , though , that adcom sounds great but that the components are made cheaply and therefore wo n't last very long the time estimates i 've heard are like only 3 or 4 years is this true \? i own the adcom 60w power amp as far as i'm concerned , there 's no amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other amps in the price range the whole amplifier is extremely solid with massive heat sinks and very solid casing if you open the amp up , there are only very good quality components in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well perfect symmetry for both channels and two transformers one for each channel the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are virtually the same as those on the classe model 70 ie very good i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed , you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so brilliant i cannot see why people say the amplifier wo n't last not with those quality components inside sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that 's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good my last point , i recently auditioned the adcom preamp something like the 545 or something it was two years old and it still sounded like new if you build an amplifier decently , like the adcom 's , they will sound brilliant and last a long time period just my thoughts , but then i do own one of adcom 's amps
11	the system , or 'family' , key would appear to be cryptographically useless , since every chip must know it and be able to remove its effects from the bitstream i daresay that it will be widely known almost immediately after this system is deployed , and since it 's been pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key the same key is used for both encryption and decryption there goes any benefit to the use of a system wide key in skipjack
15	4 \) nothing unclean shall enter heaven \( rev 21 27 \) therefore , babies are born in such a state that should they die , they are cuf off from god and put in hell , which is exactly the doctrine of st augustine and st thomas of coures , having only original sins on thier souls , they suffer the lightest punishment , the loss of the vision oand presence of god , but that does not change the undeniable fact that they cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin , nor can they inherit eternal life that , as st augustine said , is what the pelagian heretics taught which is why he said later , if you want to be a christian , do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a forgivenss of original sin

1	hi everyone , i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse 1 0 2 multiverse is a multi user , non immersive , x windows based virtual reality system , primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model , using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users \( apart from performance \) generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects \( allowing attachment of cameras and light sources \) multiple light sources \( ambient , point and spot \) objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attached functionality client the client is built around a 'fast' render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user 's viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user 's actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects \( with associated addressing \) o multiple light sources and types \( ambient , point and spot \) o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading \( optional wireframe for faster frame rates \) o mouse and keyboard input \( some people may be disappointed that this software does n't support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it ca n't , but because i do n't have one ! this will , however , be one of the first enhancements ! \) server \( s \) this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to \( current events supported init , move , change , collide terminate \) o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported , plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world \( wld \) file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild ! at a minimum you should let the objects move \( by calling a move function \) and let the server sleep for a bit \( to avoid outrunning the clients \) that 's all there is to it ! and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i 've provided generic 81 lines dactyl 270 lines \( more complicated collision detection due to the stairs !

15	greetings , probably a tired old horse , but maybe with a slightly different twist i wanted to know if there are any good english language texts for learning ancient hebrew , and how these compare with german educational texts qualitywise , if anybody has an idea i ca n't figure out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to the u s something i find interesting about studying theology in germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language learning out of the way early i'm not a theology student , but i spend a lot of time with such folks in their careers they take the first two years or so to just do greek and latin and hebrew possibly aramaic , too who knows what 's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the states \? is there a lot of language instruction done \? i really do n't have a basis for comparison regards , phil philip sells is anything too hard for the lord \? k053730 hobbes kzoo edu gen 18 14

4	i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them does n't have an fpu it does seem to be an option , even though it really is n't well , then allow me to end your confusion the c650 only come with an lc040 in the base 4 80 configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu good question i have been wondering that since feb 10th this is possible , but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lc040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040 's fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc040 out and pop in a full '040 they did \? i think i would double check this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the c610 can be upgraded to a full '040
17	i do n't , though when i was in israel i did make a point of listening to jtv news , as well as monte carlo radio in the united states , i generally read the nyt , and occasionally , a mainstream israeli newpaper what you may not be taking into account is that the jp is no longer representative of the mainstream in israel it was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control , most of the liberal and left wing reporters walked out the new owner stated in the past , more than once , that the jp 's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting israel 's position , more than attacking the gov't \( likud at the time \) the paper that i would recommend reading , being middle stream and factual is ha aretz or at least this was the case two years ago and what about the nat'l enquirer \? 8 \) but seriously , if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers one could arrive at other conclusions the information you received was highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move
11	with all the talk about this clipper chip , i have developed one question how does it work \? \? \? if you use this , then how does it get decrypted on the other end \? does the other party \( receiving the phone call mail etc \) have to know some code to undo it \? do i use a different method for calling one party than i would for another \? if the other party can decrypt it , does n't that mean that someone else could also \? i assume that if everyone has a different key , the only use would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key this seems like a fundamental question to me , but i have very little experience with cryptosystems , other than des if someone could give me an explanation as to how it would be used \( remember that i have had little experience with this sort of thing \) it would be very much appreciated
3	unfortunately there a lot of such software i also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is bad in this regard is commercial software way too many commercial packages are very poorly written but then most of the programs in ms dos are crap , such as the print command tsr that locks up your system for long periods of time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick back to comm software i find success with telix \( my com3 at 3e8 5 works ok on telix \)

15	i finished reading a very good book , the will of god , weatherhead this was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of god weatherhead broke the will of god into three distinct parts intentional will , circumstancial will , and ultimate will he \( weatherhead \) also refuted the last statement \( above \) by michael parkin above quite nicely summarizing despite the failures of humankind , god 's ultimate will is never to be defeated god 's intentions may be interfered with , even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind , brought down by circumstance his ultimate will \( the reconcilication of all humankind \) will never be stopped time after time , weatherhead used the cross as the best description of this process at work his points , paraphrased , were 1 \) god 's intentional will was for jesus , the christ , to live out a full life and perform the work of the living god 2 \) the failures , sins , and deviousness of humankind frustrated god 's intent for his son 3 \) despite the circumstance , god 's ultimate will was revealed in the cross , as jesus willingly \( not my will , lord , but yours \) died for the redemption of all humankind the cross was utterly triumphant , overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances it was not the intentional will of god it was the circumstancial will , thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will right , intentional will \( just like the jewish people we know neither the time nor the place he will return as a thief in the night peace rob

19	i posted this several days ago for dave butler he may have missed it my usenet board has changed a little just in case he missed it , here it is again dave butler writes from daveb pogo wv tek com \( dave butler \) subject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered \( judas \) date thu apr 1 20 52 11 1993 i can basically restrict this post to showing the type of evidence mr decenso has presented , and answering his two questions \( and a couple of his spurious insults and false claims \) my reply o k db by the way mr decenso , you really should have looked in the index of your bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon you would have found that the word in acts for lot is kleros , not chorion as stated by mr archer , and nowhere in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to theological dictionary of the new testament by bromley , is the meaning burial plot discussed it discusses the forms of kleros \( eg kleros , kleroo , etc \) , and the various meanings of kleros \( eg plot of land , and inheritance \) , but mentions nothing about chorion or burial plot \( why does this not surprise me \? \) thus it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference db later corrected himself from daveb pogo wv tek com \( dave butler \) subject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered \( judas \) date fri apr 2 02 32 11 1993 i owe the group an apology it is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors in my last article i stated i was wrong i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar , and thus confused kleros , the second to last word in acts 1 17 as being the plot of land discussed in actuality it is chorion , which is the last word acts 1 18 unfortunately my greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so i cannot report as to the nuances of the word i do n't know if someone else would have caught this , though i am sure that someone would be able to do so , but i have an aversion to disseminating mistakes , especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point my reply vary noble of you dave i did n't want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong \( although i am researching chorion a little \) db of course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger and bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso of actually believing bullinger , he replied that i misquoted him of my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article actually mr decenso , you said that there was benefit to our argument , in that it caused to to rediscover bullinger 's exegisis i did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial , unless you were convinced by it my reply thank you for correcting your restating of my points db and mr decenso also replied thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such drek convincing he should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of this is what bullinger believed , not necessarily what i believe so which is it mr decenso \? do you find the exegisis convincing or not \? \) my reply one of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various bible scholars and students alike when i present my views , i will clearly distinguish them from now on db of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented no greek exegisis at all , and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual greek thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement my reply good point but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory , you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations nor have you dug deeper i'm glad you have begun in this post i will begin greek studies on these passages in more depth than i thought necessary , as well db it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as evidence now we know what he claims for a standard , as he has stated it often enough but are these actual standards he has used , or simply empty hyperbole let 's see , he has used \( a \) , and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages , we see that he has also used \( b \) on the other hand he has presented no use of \( d \) historical context or \( e \) historical content or \( f \) other pertinent historical info or \( g \) cultural context or \( h \) cultural content or \( i \) other pertinent cultural info or \( j \) grammatical construction or even \( k \) hebrew and greek word studies remember , archer and bullinger do n't count thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings my reply question do you find such criteria important \? if so , do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability , or will you continue to present shallow observations \( i do n't mean this in a bad way \) at this point in our debates , i have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages , since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re judas in acts and matthew , but i will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria , since you desire me to i hope you will also it will greatly enhance our study of these passages db the only thing he has actually used , beyond the passage itself , is any other passage thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be my reply the reason is simple you are mistating the passages you claim that the passages contradict one another i do not see the passages contradicting one another \( 1 \) they may very well be complimentary , as many scholarly sources mention \( 2 \) matthew may not be presenting judas' death , as you claim but we 'll look at your defense of this later also , the reward of iniquity in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of silver in matthew 's passages \( although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is \) at this beginning stages in our debates , we are laying some scriptural groundwork , which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis db of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with judas' death , is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct my reply one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary however , i see no problem in tony rose 's explanation of judas' death how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging himself in matthew 27 5 and falling headlong he burst open this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious , irreconcilable error some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts however , this is not the case at all matthew relates that judas hanged himself , while peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact the two statements are indeed different , but do they necessarily contradict each other \? matthew does not say that judas did not fall neither does peter say that judas did not hang himself this is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white both accounts can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined from the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore , it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open it is important to remember that we are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time on the other hand , a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself , while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building in this case , both are true , as both are true in the case of matthew 's and peter 's accounts of the death of judas it is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event your only reason for rejecting this is , i believe , your attempt to discredit inerrancy you have n't related how this is impossible or highly unlikely here 's what you said in an earlier post db quoting tony rose the added text in this version is so heavy that , assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics , you should find it not credible but you seem to find tony rose 's eisegesis satisfactory , while clearly rejecting david joslin 's here , you discredit tony 's explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the passages but you have n't addressed why you feel that way you can say it 's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction , but that does n't tell me it did n't happen , nor have you shown why you reject that possibility questions is matthew lying or is luke lying \? or are they both lying \? or are either or both of them misinformed \? why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction \? i do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect db at present though , mr decenso only asks two questions of me actually i find question \( 1 \) to be a rather stupid request , but i will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points first i would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging \( except in fantasy cowboy movies \) , and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging my reply i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect today , i got a call re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack he failed in his attempt and is in a child 's psych ward at a local hospital hanging attempts are not always successful to assume that because most hangings are successful , this one was also is begging the question , if i may quote you last night , listening to the bible answer man broadcast , the christian research institute 's show , one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use i am not all that familiar with them the man on the bam show teaches comparative religion and logic it was interesting db this is so prevalent that , so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself my reply qualifiers are important at times , as we 'll see in an ot passage i 'll mention below does hanging always have this outcome \? did matthew , who is the only source we have re judas hanging himself , state that judas died as a result \? to say it 's synonymous means it has the same meaning as a boy \( age 14 \) hung himself but he lived this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover db now i am not alone in this thought in fact , since mr decenso so respects christian scholarly \( including greek scholars \) opinion , i did some research my reply thank you , dave db interestingly , not one of the christian references i read , interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide my reply above , mine so it 's ok to use christian sources to back your points \? what about tony 's position do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility \? also , is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong , or lying , or deceived in other parts of their books \? if so , should we do , as we have done with archer , toss them to the side and not value anything they say , including their interpretation of the hanging of judas \? i am sure you would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources you also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died although that is very possibly true , do you find that in the text itself \? remember , that 's the first criteria we must examine db this included the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck my reply which i own it 's a good source of commentary info but not inerrant db the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible by laydon the one volume bible commentary by j r dunelow word meanings of the testament ralph earl the abingdon bible commentary published by abingdon harpers bible commentary by william neal \( actually i could have presented many more as well \) my reply i appreciate your doing this research , dave maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions more in depth study db in each case , these references specifically describe that the interpretation of matt 27 5 as successful , suicide and thus i can only conclude that the greek word apagchw \( ie hang oneself \) is translated as a successful hanging my reply above , mine no you ca n't only conclude this , although , as tony says , this was a highly probable outcome but matthew does not state death as being a result the greek word is apagcho matthew 27 5 is it 's only occurrence in the new testament in the septuagint \( the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus \) , it 's only used in 2 samuel 17 23 now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to his house , to his city then he put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died and he was buried in his father 's tomb notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr sept , apagcho , but it explicitly adds , and died here we have no doubt of the result in matthew , we are not explicitly told judas died also , there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure it simply means hang oneself db but mr decenso , you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful my reply above , mine reputable \? you mean ones that have never erred \? as far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful , that ca n't be done , even by me as i said in an earlier post although i still agree with tony 's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding judas' death \( taking into account several criteria \) , i 've recently noticed some new things in matthew mat 27 5 8 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , it is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood and they consulted together and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day first of all , notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of hanging all it says is that he went and hanged himself luke however , in acts , tells us that and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out this is a pretty clear indication \( along with the other details given in acts peter 's speech , the need to pick a new apostle , etc \) that at least after judas' fall , he was dead so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highly probable , but not clear cut i also wrote my reply here we have a stickler , dave , that i have to say i just recently noticed let 's look at the passage in matthew mat 27 4 saying , i have sinned by betraying innocent blood and they said , what is that to us \? you see to it ! mat 27 5 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself mat 27 6 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , it is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood mat 27 7 and they consulted together and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in mat 27 8 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day notice verse 5 then he went and hanged himself matthew does not say judas died , does it \? should we assume he died as a result of the hanging \? what does acts say \? act 1 18 \( now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalms 'let his dwelling place be desolate , and let no one live in it' and , 'let another take his office ' here we may have a graphic explanation of judas' death so , my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re the two accounts of judas' death is this matthew does n't necessarily explain how judas died he does say judas hanged himself , but he did n't specifically say judas died in the hanging incident however , acts seems to show us his graphic demise therefore , there is no contradiction between matthew and acts re judas' `death' my reply we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death although it 's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks , thereby bursting open , i can no longer assume that to be the case therefore , no contradiction matthew did not say judas died as a result of the hanging , did he \? most scholars believe he probably did , but \? i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars' explanations , but in looking at the texts initially , we ca n't assume judas died it is , however , highly probable db by the way , while all agree that judas died from the hanging , the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing one simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthew 's version as the correct version in both matt and acts the biblical knowledge commentary suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted , his belly exploded \( which does n't explain his headlong fall \) , or that his branch or rope broke , and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out \( which does n't explain how a hanging man , would fall headlong rather than feet first \) my reply the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors how high the person was suspended before the fall , any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall , how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon , thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks , etc in a superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage , we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics , but tony in the above quoted post gave us some a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined from the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore , it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open db now truthfully , i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the source of the potter 's field prophesy , but on the other hand the author is correct matthew does make that confusion of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god , will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas \( ie where the prophesy of the potter 's field came from \) my reply please , when we are done with this study on his death , remind me to discuss this with you db as to your second question mr decenso , you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land , was indeed for the betrayal , rather than some other source i would point out that in acts , where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity acts 1 18 , it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about \( ie acts 1 16 concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus \) now i would point out that when the bible describes an act of iniquity , and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity , it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed my reply dave , we are getting somewhere , are n't we ! act 1 15 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples \( altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty \) , and said , act 1 16 men and brethren , this scripture had to be fulfilled , which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas , who became a guide to those who arrested jesus act 1 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry act 1 18 \( now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out act 1 19 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem so that field is called in their own language , akel dama , that is , field of blood \) act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalms 'let his dwelling place be desolate , and let no one live in it' and , 'let another take his office ' notice that in verse 16 , the word iniquity is not used rather , it states that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus but the writer did not stop there vs 17 , for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry what part did judas play in their ministry \? joh 12 6 this he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the money box and he used to take what was put in it joh 13 29 for some thought , because judas had the money box , that jesus had said to him , buy those things we need for the feast , or that he should give something to the poor so , now we know what part judas played he was a treasurer , per se right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry \( treasurer , according to john \) , then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity money that should have been put into the ministry , but was stolen by judas to purchase a field i believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are what do you think , dave \? db now since i have given you clear answers \( and even references \) , perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are \( instead of asking me what type i think you are , as you did to mr joslin \) my reply i will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist , although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view frank

16	you 're getting warmer the 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move what this means is the damned thing wo n't go off until the trigger is pulled this makes it just about \( there have been some problems , but we 're assuming the gun is functioning correctly \) as safe as a revolver the gun when working correctly is totally drop safe now , in police work this is a consideration there is not a single documented case i'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm there are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and could n't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun , thus the proprietary nature of the safety \( to the criminal at least \) very likely prevented the office from getting shot the purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire this does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use ! thus the glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint , but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else by this criteria it does make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece from the standpoint of police use , it is no better \( or worse \) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it the ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm ca n't be used by anybody but it 's owner , but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps , unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm

11	archive name ripem faq last update 31 mar 93 22 00 00 0500 about this posting this is a listing of likely questions and information about ripem , a program for public key mail encryption it \( this faq , not ripem \) was written and will be maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis follow up discussion specific to ripem is redirected to the group alt security ripem what 's new i am now running a world wide web archive of ripem information it does not contain much of anything that is n't available elsewhere , but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this faq and some other stuff the url is http cs indiana edu ripem dir html this month 's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that i 've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering i hope i do n't have to edit this again soon \) disclaimer nothing in this faq should be considered legal advice , or anything other than one layperson 's opinion if you want real legal advice , talk to a real lawyer , preferably one with experience in patent law , export regulations , or whatever area of law is in question list of questions 1 \) what is ripem \? 2 \) how can i get ripem \? 3 \) will ripem run on my machine \? 4 \) will ripem work with my mailer \? 5 \) what is rsa \? 6 \) what is des \? 7 \) what is a fingerprint , like md5 \? 8 \) what is pem \? 9 \) what 's this about distributing and authenticating keys \? 10 \) is n't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem \? 11 \) what about rsadsi pkp \? 12 \) why do all ripem public keys look very similar \? 13 \) what is pgp \? 14 \) what about rpem \? 15 \) what is mime \? 16 \) what is tis pem \? 17 \) i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem questions and answers 1 \) what is ripem \? ripem is a \( not yet complete , but useful \) implementation of privacy enhanced mail \( pem \) ripem allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by pem disclosure protection \( optional \) , originator authenticity , message integrity measures , and non repudiation of origin \( always \) \( see what is pem \? \) ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss3 cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain , except for the rsa routines , which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc the current version of ripem is 1 0 5 the current version of the macintosh port of ripem is 0 7 2 \) how can i get ripem \? ripem uses the library of cryptographic routines rsaref , which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the u s or canada without an export license no such license has been obtained \( nor would one likely be granted unless the rsa key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than des there are some suggestions that this situation may change now that clinton is in office \) the author requests in the readme file that this law not be violated please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this is a personal request from me , the author of ripem , and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain , and a license for it is included with the distribution you should read it before using ripem ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info note that the non rsaref portion of ripem is not a product of rsa data security , incorporated they merely are helping distribute it ripem , as well as some other crypt stuff , has its home site on ripem msu edu , which is open to non anonymous ftp for users in the u s and canada who are citizens or permanent residents to find out how to obtain access , ftp there , cd to pub crypt , and read the file getting access for convenience , binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree 3 \) will ripem run on my machine \? probably it has already been ported to ms dos and most flavors of unix \( sunos , next , linux , aix , ultrix , solaris , etc \) ports to macintosh include a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau , author of stuffit more ports are expected , and help of users is invited 4 \) will ripem work with my mailer \? probably how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer , though the users guide , included with the distribution , discusses ways to use ripem with many popular mailers , including berkeley , mush , elm , and mh code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use , secure , and may be useful to others , feel free to post it to alt security ripem 5 \) what is rsa \? rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric , or public key this means that there are two different , related keys one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one cannot \( reasonably \) be derived from the other , you may publish your encryption , or public , key widely and keep your decryption , or private , key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message , but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it note that the message sent with rsa is normally just the des key to the real plaintext \( see what is des \? \) note that the above only provides for disclosure protection for originator authenticity , message integrity , and non repudiation of origin services to be implemented , the fingerprint of the message \( see what is a fingerprint , like md5 \? \) is encrypted with the sender 's private key the recipient , or a dispute resolving authority , can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered rsa was named for the three men \( rivest , shamir and adleman \) who invented it to find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography in general , ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq some information also may be in sci crypt 6 \) what is des \? des is the data encryption standard , a widely used symmetric , or secret key , crypto system unlike rsa , des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however , des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient 's public rsa key and includes the result in the letter , allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however , it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future , because there is a strong feeling that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability 7 \) what is a fingerprint , like md5 \? md5 is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a 128 bit fingerprint , or cryptographically secure hash , of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible \( in a reasonable amount of computation \) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus , instead of signing the entire message with the sender 's private key , only the md5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication md5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example , ripem public keys include an md5 of the public key in the file , so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md5s of keys and verify their accuracy md5 is sometimes used for other purposes for example , it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data , as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md5 is described in its entirety \( including an implementation in c \) in rfc 1321 there have been some recent suggestions that md5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true 8 \) what is pem \? pem is privacy enhanced mail , a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts it is described in rfcs 1421 1424 these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs 1113 1115 ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem , because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys , which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned 9 \) what 's this about distributing and authenticating keys \? for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you , she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her , you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours , she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server , the distributed finger servers , and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management by certificates the addition of this feature to ripem is planned , but chicken egg issues still exist 10 \) is n't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem \? this issue has been considered in the standards process rfc 1310 , the specification for internet standards , has a discussion \( section 6 \) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard rfc 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public key cryptography this does not , of course , mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement an interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public key cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive \( available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf \) in the files bidzos letter and bidzos response \( amusingly , the lpf files on ftp uu net are compressed with a patented algorithm \) 11 \) what about rsadsi pkp \? rsa data security , inc \( rsadsi \) is a california based company specializing in cryptographic technologies public key partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights of the following u s patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method \( diffie hellman \) no 4 , 200 , 770 public key cryptographic apparatus and method \( hellman merkle \) no 4 , 218 , 582 cryptographic communications system and method \( rsa \) no 4 , 405 , 829 exponential cryptographic apparatus and method \( hellman pohlig \) no 4 , 424 , 414 pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography the two businesses are rather closely related \( for example , the same person , jim bidzos , is president of both of them \) pkp has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies \( ibm , dec , motorola , at t , lotus \) for use in their products pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than its use of the rsaref library , and for no reason other than its author 's desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however , after the ball started rolling , people at rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site , and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built on rsaref in 1992 award 12 \) why do all ripem public keys look very similar \? ripem public keys begin with a pkcs \( public key cryptography standards \) identifier describing various characteristics about the key , so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people 's keys this does not mean your keys are similar , but only that they are the same class of key , were generated with the same program , are of the same length , etc 13 \) what is pgp \? pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem , and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way , though pgp does also use rsa a few major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features , particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem uses rsaref , a library of rsa routines from rsadsi which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa pkp claims that it is a violation of its patents to make , use or sell pgp in the u s or canada without either a license or written permission \( see disclaimer \) \( see what about rsadsi pkp \? \) phil zimmermann , the author of pgp , stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged , but it has n't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future he acknowledges in the pgp user 's guide in fact , if you live in the usa , and you are not a federal agency , you should n't actually run pgp on your computer , because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted , and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada without an export license however , pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever , the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues unfortunately , it 's not distributed separately from the program , which can be difficult to find in the u s on ftp sites due to liability concerns 14 \) what about rpem \? rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem , but used a public key cipher invented by rabin \( which is not rsa \) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public key systems it was written by mark riordan , who later wrote ripem its distribution was halted when , contrary to the beliefs of many \( including rabin \) , pkp claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed this claim is not universally accepted , but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp 15 \) what is mime \? mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions , and is described in rfc 1341 you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime a faq exists on it how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter 16 \) what is tis pem \? trusted information systems is working on a version of privacy enhanced mail for general availability last i heard , it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent \( mh \) rather than a stand alone system , and in beta test i do n't know much more than that 17 \) i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem
19	no matter how absurd it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute , it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible in fact , for the bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code , it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use the jewish talmud is the result of centuries of biblical scholars analysing every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it the children of israel were given a very strict set of moral , civil , judicial and ceremonial laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their society for a christian , the situation is no better it seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo christian god is that which is contained in the bible \( which we can see from the diverse opinions in the christian newsgroups is not clear \) there may well be an absolute morality defined by the judeo christian god for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man this leads to the problem of defining morality for our society if we take the divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways \( as an example , consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer justice \) if we take an agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society \( with all the danger that this implies \) alternatively , we could take the basis of the judeo christian morality and interpret extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live righteously \( as many christian and non christian philosophers have done \) whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society , i think the important aspect is the result david on religion

11	each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f , an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips n , a 30 bit serial number u , an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip hmmm a thirty bit serial number and , we are told , the unit key u is derived deterministically from this serial number that means that there are only one billion possible unit keys to generate the unit key for a serial number n , the 30 bit value n is first padded with a fixed 34 bit block to produce a 64 bit block n1 s1 and s2 are then used as keys to triple encrypt n1 , producing a 64 bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly , n is padded with two other 34 bit blocks to produce n2 and n3 , and two additional 64 bit blocks r2 and r3 are computed r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 , r2 , and r3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits the first 80 bits are assigned to u1 and the second 80 bits to u2 the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies hmmm we must assume that generating the unit key u from the serial number n rather than generating it from a randomly selected u1 and u2 is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government u is completedly determined given s1 , s2 and n if s1 and s2 do not change they constitute effective master keys \( along with f \) , the theft of which \( or the possession of which by various authorities \) completely obviates the security of the system however , more interestingly , we know , for a fact that if s1 and s2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for u is no more than 2 30 why not pick u1 and u2 at random \? why this interesting restriction of they key space if it not to provide an additional back door \? i find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin even if s1 and s2 change periodically , the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security if s1 and s2 do not change , even if they remain secret i wonder if they can somehow be back derived given enough unit key serial number pairs we are assured that this cannot happen but no one understands how skipjack works outside of government officials and , soon , foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage presumably we will eventually have the information as well reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year but by the time we know it may be too late as a sequence of values for u1 , u2 , and u are generated , they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u1 the second disk is similar but contains the u2 values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed , all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind none of this makes me feel the least bit secure the silly notion of destroying the laptop appears to be yet another bizarre distraction we all know that you ca n't read data from dram that has been turned off for more than a few moments on the other hand , what we do n't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from s1 and s2 in the first place other than to weaken the system we do n't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information its probably worth hundreds of million , so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist and to tell you the truth , doing this in a vault rather than in joe random tempest shielded room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high school dropouts from peoria impressed but it does very little for most of the rest of us the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s1 and s2 , and the second two \( the escrow agents \) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies what would this provide \? lets say the escrow agencies are the aclu and the nra and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest who cares \? the nsa must be laughing out loud , because they have the algorithm to regenerate u given n and likely do n't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them perry metzger pmetzger shearson com

3	this may be the dumbest question of the year , but is there a way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6 slot motherboard \( all 16 bit \) to get the usual 8 \? my case has slots for 8 , and i 'd like to get a scanner , but with all my other cards i'm already max 'd out ! i'm hoping that a simple solution exists , e g an adapter that turns i'm not sure if this will work , but how about using one of those 't' expanders used in the low profile cases they allow 3 5 slots staggered on either side of the card you can install it in the last slot , and then \( probably \) have 2 or 3 sideways slots this is actually how it is done in the low profile cases a standard motherboard , the 't' connector in one slot , and the expansion cards plugged into the 't' i guess you could do this at each end of the slots \( 1 8 \) to add even more the 't' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them no electronics on it the only downside your case wo n't close , but for a homebrew system , that may not be a problem do n't know about performance , though i 'll leave that discussion to the engineers

8	for discussion purposes , i will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe , and try to paint a useful mental picture 1 unless an engine is supercharged , the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric at the time the intake valve is opened , the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure \( left over after the exhaust stroke \) and atmospheric as the piston decends on the intake stroke , combustion chamber pressure is decreased , allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract at no time does the pressure ever become negative , or even approach a good vacuum 2 at the time of the exhaust valve closing , the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction \( the muffler \) note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake , because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion 3 in the last 6 8 years , the japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning , in pursuit of almighty horsepower at this point in time , on high performance bikes , substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance , because the stock intake system flows very well anyway substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference , unless \( in general \) the new exhaust system is much louder than the stocker 4 on older bikes , exhaust back pressure was the dominating factor if free flowing air filters were substituted , very little difference was noted , unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as well 5 in general , an engine can be visualized as an air pump at any given rpm , anything that will cause the engine to pump more air , be it on the intake or exhaust side , will cause it to produce more horsepower pumping more air will require recalibration \( rejetting \) of the carburetor

11	a unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp agrep 2 0 4 a fast approximate pattern matching tool source code project available from cs arizona edu in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options the one most obviously applicable to cryptography \( key selection \) is to be able to specify the similarity of matches in the data for example say you make up a password phrase of qimwe7l of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list but how close is it to en entry that could be varied by some crack program to brute force search for it \? you use agrep to find out looking with argument for none , one or two errors , no matches good so far but agrep 3 qimwe7l bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern qimwe7l is too close to the pattern imsel \( part of himself and a host of others \) , to be of any cryptographic value as a key an error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like teh for the a minimally acceptable password would have to pass as least level 3 in order not immediately ruled out as even a remote possibility of being a good password \( in real cryptographic use , my personal passphrases clear at least level 8 on my rather large 80 meg word and phrase lists \) and for searching for key words in human typed data \( lots o' typos \) the tool is unexcelled for example , for example , say i want to find out what people think about gibson 's sf book neuromancer in the huge sf lover 's archives even with an error distance specification as small as of 1 i will find all those people who think the title was necromancer or other common typos why miss anything \? also , the program can look for up to 30 , 000 patterns in parallel at boyer moore \( sublinear \) speeds great for a nsa wannabe to look for your name , terrorists names , special tagalog or religious words , etc in the news or e mail spool directories you can even search for ciphertext by using , say , 30 , 000 random three byte combinations and eliminate all texts that do n't score the x chi square 'birthday' hits on message size y you think some crypto terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you \? no problem try agrep p nsa to find nsa , national security agency , nsecag , no such agency , national scrabble association , n s a , etc you can also specify fixed areas looking for license plate xyz123 when you know that the letters are correct , you might say agrep 2 xyz 123 licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with xyz with up to two errors \( addition , substitution , deletion \) in the number area you can also weight the relative cost for substiutions , additions , or deletion errors for example , when searching dna patterns for a particular protein combination , you might know that some kinds of damage cause the a nucelotide to drop out more than other errors you could adjust for this bias by setting dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors a steganographic use \( i even used agrep 2 steg eograp e just now to find the correct spelling ! \) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext also with agrep 's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the hits into a useful form for example , agrep d from 'pgp \( passphrase zimmerman nsa \) ' says output the entire mail record , delimited by 'from' that contains 'pgp' and contains either 'passphrase' , 'zimmerman' , or 'nsa' and agrep has been measured an order of magnitude faster than the second best similarity tool publicly available as usual , i will be glad to e mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e mail if they cannot do an anonymous ftp get this now it is too powerful to stay in the hands of the nsa grady ward , vendor to the nsa \( and proud of it \)

17	at issue was not a trial behind closed doors , but arrest , trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed it has happened before , and there is reason to believe it still goes on read this from ma'ariv , february 18 \( possibly 28 \) , 1992 publication ban the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public by baruch me'iri all those involved in this matter politely refused my request , one way or another look , the subject is too delicate if i comment on it , i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case , even hint at it , i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest , and later on their imprisonment in israel of 1993 , citizens are imprisoned without us , the citizens of this country , knowing anything about it not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison , for security offenses , in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the days of the lavon ya affair we heard about the third man being in prison but many years have passed since then , and what existed then can today no longer be found even in south american countries , or in the former communist countries but it appears that this is still possible in israel of 1993 the chair of the knesset committee on law , the constitution and justice , mk david zucker , sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister , the minister of justice , and the cabinet legal advisor ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter during the past several years a number of israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses in some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted , but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those cases , after being legally convicted , the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner , asserts mk zucker on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that , there is absolutely no question that it is possible , and in some cases it is imperative , that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials but even in such cases the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public however , one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person 's arrest , and on the name of a person sentenced to prison , is justified and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister , the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret , wrote zucker the legal counsel of the civil rights union , attorney mordechai shiffman said that , we , as the civil rights union , do not know of any cases of security prisoners , citizens of israel , who are imprisoned , and whose imprisonment cannot be made public this is a situation which , if it actually exists , is definitely unhealthy just like censorship is an unhealthy matter the union is aware , says shiffman , of cases where notification of a suspect 's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld i am speaking only of several days i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that is done because of the great secrecy the suspect himself , his family , his lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity the journalist knows nothing of the arrest , and so almost everyone is happy attorney yossi arnon , an official of the bar , claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today , a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible nothing is easier the court orders a publication ban , and that 's that someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it do you find this situation acceptable \? attorney arnon definitely not we live in a democratic country , and such a state of affairs is impermissible i am well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total non publication , silence , is unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison the trial was held behind closed doors , nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to it is somehow possible to understand , though not to accept , the reasons , but , as i have noted , we at least are aware of his imprisonment why is the matter actually that serious \? ca n't we trust the discretion of the court \? attorney arnon the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them the judges do not have the tools to investigate this gives the government enormous power , power which they can misuse and what if there really is a security issue \? attorney arnon i am a man of the legal system , not a security expert democracy stands in opposition to security i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges without entering into detail we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused , in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public attorney shiffman , on the other hand , believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect 's arrest , or of a convicted criminal 's imprisonment a healthy situation \? definitely not but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal , former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir clearly , we are speaking of isolated special cases such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication nevertheless , adds shtendal , the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban , to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles i 've mentioned the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services , but with the court , which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt

11	the supreme court seems to disagree with you they have stated that the people is a term of art refering to an individual right , and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example i quote 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the constitution the preamble declares that the constitution is ordained , and established by 'the people of the the u s ' the second amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms supreme court of the u s , u s v uerdugo uriquidez \( 1990 \) furthermore , in the miller decision , they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons unfortunately , no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years however , that does not change the interpretation furthermore , it appears that others disagree with you as well , vis the conclusion is thus inescapable that the history , concept , and wording of the second amendment to the constitution of the united states , as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half century after its ratifi cation , indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner report of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary , united states senate , 97th congress , second session \( february 1982 \) you might rightfully ask well then , what does that first bit about militias mean \? well , militia in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country \( indeed , the u s code still defines militia as all armed men over the age of 17 \) the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense and these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time supreme court of the united states , u s v miller \( 1939 \) the reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment , which was this by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country , no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny in short , the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people , rather than the other way around no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government thomas jefferson , proposal virginia constitution , june 1776 1 thomas jefferson papers , 334 \( c j boyd , ed , 1950 \) and what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance \? let them take arms the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants thomas jefferson \( letter to william s smith , 1787 , in jefferson , on democracy 20 , s padover , ed , 1939 \) before a standing army can rule , the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom of europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed , and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be , on any pretense , raised in the united states noah webster , an examination into the leading principles of the federal constitution \( 1787 \) , in pamphlets on the constitution of the united states \( p ford , 1888 \) you may disagree with the second amendment , and wish that it be repealed , but please do not pretend that it is n't there and that it does n't mean what it says you might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present , but you ca n't imagine it away i could fill a book with detailed argumentation many have already however , none of this has anything to do with cryptography lets get it out of here if you insist on discussing this , please do it in talk politics guns , where people will gladly discuss this matter with you perry metzger pmetzger shearson com

15	first of all , i resent your assumption that you know why i am threatened by science , or even that i am threatened at all , although i admit the latter the reason i am threatened by science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord 's existence god reveals himself in many ways , including , to some degree , science my problem with science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves god endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations , for example , but he did not make that availible to everyone does that mean that if science can over ride god 's decision through alterations , that god wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children \? should men be allowed to have babies , if that is made possible people have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally , and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally the closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death , and as god has reserved judgement about when people should die to himself , i believe we should rely on god 's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world this is not to say that i reject all forms of medical treatment , however treatment that alleviates pain , or prevents pain from occuring , is perfectly acceptable , i believe , as it was acceptable for jesus to cure the sick however , treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason , or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes , go too far are we not happy with the beauty god gave us \? i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i would approve of scientific study , and where i would not , but i will say this before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets , one should ask why they want this knowledge before one alters the body they have been given , they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is i cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases , but i will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe , and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to god
18	canada 's gst is collected as a sales tax and is considered a vat funnily , the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax \( or , people never paid mind to it , thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the gst one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again \) the stated intent of the tories was to use the gst to write down our deficit unfortunately , their legislation did n't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow i do n't know what is involved in releasing the funds , but one dilemna is that the tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending , they 've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time the end of their second term \( 9 years \) while they do have chances of getting a third term , catching up in the polls to their more moderate slightly leftish pro business rivals , the liberals \( as in euro uk \) , the tories' heir apparent for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of hillary clinton gld

15	i 've been thinking about the idea that was raised \( by michael covington , i think \) that words mean what we think they mean , regardless of etymology i 've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes i grew up in a home where christ was a bad word people who were very angry said it the word christian meant someone who was not a jew it carried connotations of otherness , of threat , of enemy it took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `christ' and `christian' when i accepted jesus , i expected to be disowned to become a christian meant to join the enemy i knew others would consider me a traitor at some level , i agreed , but was still prepared to pay this price like esau , i sold my birthright however , i made a better bargain he only got some stew , but i got the incomparable riches of knowing christ as it turned out , my parents did not disown me i found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that i would grow out of by the time they had decided it was n't a phase , they were sort of used to it they did n't disown me but they did n't completely accept the situation either for example , they did n't come to my wedding because it was in a church when i visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death , she said to me , as far as i'm concerned , you still are a jew what she meant was that she loved me and forgave me but i am not a jew i am a christian \( i 'll concede , one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls \) \) i do not keep kosher i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday my sons are not circumcised but these things are true of some people who do consider themselves jews it is not these rules that make people jews it is the heritage from the past i gave up the past this is why i find it hard to relate to messianic jews their experience is unlike mine they still consider themselves jews while following jesus some would even say that i must do so , too i am at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage it was not something i valued very much when i gave it but i did have a sense that i was giving it for god it may have been a small sacrifice it may have been an unnecessary sacrifice but i gave it and do not want to ask for it back and while i do n't have the heritage i was born with , i do have another i am an outcast from the house of israel , but i am a member of the church one of the things i like about being a catholic christian is that it is rich in tradition it gives me a feeling of , once again , being rooted in the past this is probably one of the reasons why i do n't like it when people mess around with christian traditions \( for example , changing the name of easter \) these traditions fill an important emotional need of mine i suppose the point of all this is that people should n't assume that all believers of jewish background are the same for some `jewish christian' is a good name , for others it is an oxymoron
19	i am a mormon i believe in christ , that he is alive he raised himself text deleted i learned that the concept of the holy trinity was never taught by jesus christ , that it was agreed to by a council of clergymen long after christ was ascended , men who had no authority to speak for him if jesus never taught the concept of the trinity , how do you deal with the following mat 28 18 then jesus came to them and said , all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me mat 28 19 therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit , mat 28 20 and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always , to the very end of the age also jesus speaking act 1 5 for john baptized with water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit i believe that you may have overlooked some key verses , that are crucial to the christian faith

12	here 's a rough sketch of how the system works a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion , sa \( selective availability \) time dithering , etc the reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position \( since it knows where it is already \) it then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers if the receivers are nearby \( 300km \) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit , the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit thus , the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit the us coast guard is currently \( as far as i know \) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps these stations will use existing radio towers i believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 khz there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies for example , pinpoint \( \( 310 \) 618 7076 \) offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 104 format advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors john p baker my opinions are my own i do n't know johns hopkins university anyone else who wants them , anyway applied physics laboratory laurel , md 20723 bakerjp1 aplcomm jhuapl edu

9	whatever you say i think it 's just 12 games into the season myself , so i'm going to wait a bit before calling names i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher , and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him on the other hand , i expect him to release otto if he does n't turn things around pretty fast \( btw , otto 's game score for that 0 ip stinker was only 22 , which points out a problem with the method since otto 's performance was infinitely bad , and excruciatingly prolonged \) i think merced 's rookie year was a bit flukey , but are n't you willing to give him some more at bats \( and tomlin a few more starts \) before acting so gloomy \? no he did n't walk is a time bomb he has no stuff whatsoever , and when the league finally realizes this , it wo n't be pretty at all do n't be so fast doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele , which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors meanwhile , i'm not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a six year free agent before the 1992 season twice through the rotation , and you 've given up \? yikes but so has his age , at least in baseball terms the useful half life of a 34 year old injury prone catcher ca n't be much longer than a year but he wanted to be a dodger , and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992 i do n't think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him he certainly was n't last year hey , that 's the skates smith package deal anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or base running \( particularly at this stage \) is a real weirdo if that 's the goal of the team ownership , than i do n't see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy i do n't know what he has or has n't said about revenue sharing , so i ca n't comment there it 's annoying , but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king , it was probably unavoidable meanwhile , i think bigger accomplishments of simmons' tenure were getting some value for john smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something in 1993 foley , smith , and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts , which means that even if fail it has n't done serious damage to the bucs' future does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case \? i never heard the outcome of this when will the final verdict be in on this \? i'm not sure who was the idiot in this case , so i do n't know who to blame it might have been doug danforth , after all in fact , i seriously suspect it was doug danforth , who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet \( btw i 've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site , so if somebody known to impersonate e e cummings can see this , would he drop me a short note \? \)

15	the next sunday , the sermon was about joshua 6 \( where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab , who had sheltered the spies \) with those reports about bosnia in my mind , i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre \( the one in joshua \) was right but what really bothered me was that , if i was going to try taking christianity seriously , i should n't be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in bosnia certainly , my sympathies should n't be with the moslims considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who , under turkish rule , converted to islam could the serbs be doing god 's work \? perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing does it reflect the attitude of god , who sends rain to both the just and the unjust \? if not , then christians should be uncomfortable with it jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known doctrinal \( or political \) correctness is not the standard , so i do n't see why christians should be moved against the serbs because their ancestors converted from christianity to islam it seems to me that as a christian you should be troubled by the ethnic cleansing

19	in my mind , to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach science has its basis in observable fact i 'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it 's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer science is a human activity and as such , is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity the myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern , that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist , is nonsense bill if one is to argue for objective values \( in a moral sense \) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective considering the meaning of the word objective i doubt that this will ever happen so , back to the original question and objective morality is \? this may be an unfortunate choice of words , almost self contradictory objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people the first term is all inclusive , the second is specific the concept supposedly described may have meaning however if there is a god as described by the christians \( for instance \) , then he has existence apart from and independent of humankind his existence is outside of our frame of reference \( reality \) if this being declares a thing to be so , it is necessarily so since he has defined himself as omnipotent and , if his claims are to be believed , he is at least omnipotent relative to us god is intrinsically self defined and all reality is whatever he says it is in an objective sense if god determines a standard of conduct , that standard is objective if human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it , they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct , giving the term morality a nebulous , meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand the standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable , does n't mean that the objective standard itself does n't exist morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm , or the preferred conduct of decent people , making it seem subjective , but it is derived from an absolute , objective , standard ironically , this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature \( according to christianity at least \) , yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre , oppressive and severe this may be due as

15	i 've heard it said that the accounts we have of christs life and ministry in the gospels were actually written many years after the event \( about 40 years or so \) is this correct \? \? if so , why the big time delay \? \? i know all scripture is inspired of god , so the time of writing is i suppose un important , but i still ca n't help be curious ! ivan thomas barr contact me at u9126619 athmail1 causeway qub ac uk the gospels are n't dated , so we can only guess luke 's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process the prolog sounds like luke is from the next generation , and had to do some investigating there are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the gospels there are debates about how reliable these traditions are they certainly do n't have the status of scripture , yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously one suggests that mark was based on peter 's sermons , and was written to preserve them when peter had died or way about to die one tradition about matthew suggests that a collection of jesus words may have been made earlier than the current gospels in the ancient world , it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information i think many people would have preferred to hear about jesus directly from someone who had known him , and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person , rather than from a book thus i suspect that the gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier , which was probably used as sources for the existing gospels establishing the dates is a complex and technical business i have to confess that i'm not sure how much reliance i 'd put on the methods used but it 's common to think that mark was written first , around 64 ad , and that all of the gospels were written by the end of the century a few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other

on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be 'old' the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring ' include' lines x c pre process the source ignoring ' define' and ' include' lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x 'cleaned up' by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all , or in most tests in certain x cases , a test is not important entries that compete for the x 'strangest most creative source layout' need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand , given x two such entries , we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such , we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason , we often award 'worst abuse of the x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x 3217 byte size limit also , abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules , and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award 'worst abuse of the rules' x and then plug the hole next year even so , we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed , if not smaller \) x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem , particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand , we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they did n't work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer , that claims that x 16 is a prime number if you do have a bug , you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes , x a strange bug feature can even help the entry ! of course , a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old' we x tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar wo n't go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code , and so do we x x define d define x d foo do n't expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j do n't use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c , such as k r c , you must avoid areas that result in x compile link errors for ansi c compilers x x unfortunately , some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of x integral type thus , the following classical obfuscation hacks should x not be used in 1993 this rule may be relaxed in future contests x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x \( i 3 \) string use string i 3 instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments , be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this , a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular , do not treat va list variables as if they were a char 's x x avoid using varargs h , use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives \( define , if , ifdef , \) , x the leading ' ' must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' ' , many do not x x because the exit \( \) function returns void on some systems , entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners , they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason , we look for x programs that are compact , and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80 x bytes long getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x \( index strchr differences are ok , but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be \) x dump core or have compiler warnings x \( it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item \) x wo n't compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers \) x x unless you are cramped for space , or unless you are entering the x 'best one liner' category , we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d 's to help out , x but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of d 's in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace , and in certain cases or do not impact x your program size \( up to a certain point \) , because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program , one that is a compact blob x of code , and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program , we tend to favor the second version of course , a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way , would definitely win over the first two ! x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self replicating' x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact , a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' , lest we \( or others \) x know of a smaller one ! x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored do n't x depend on a particular type of display for example , do n't depend x on color or a given size do n't require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set \( libx11 a , libxaw a , libxmu a and libxt a \) x do n't use m tif , xv ew , or openl ok toolkits , since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x11r5 , and some people are stuck back in x11r4 \( or x earlier \) , so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5 better x yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so , be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint \( not a requirement , but it is nice \) x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up \) x x some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas of course , your x program does n't have to excel in all areas , but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting , creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted

did not unpack correctly \) information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete , and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end , who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous , unless they win an award x because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced , we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files , and shred all related paper by tradition , we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received \( for the curious , x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks \) x x after the usenix announcement , we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round , x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus , an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section \( s \) , if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds , other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries , entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries , we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client \( see our likes and dislikes \) x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example , a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them , if necessary x x in the final round process , we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries \( typically about 25 \) down to 8 or 10 x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round , is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is beat out x by a similar , but slightly better entry for this reason , it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes , of course , x that the entry is worth improving in the first place ! x x more often that not , we select a small entry \( usually one line \) , a x strange creative layout entry , and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end , we traditionally pick one entry as 'best' sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often , the x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement , occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition , x this is done during the

8	this thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago while i was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why i was going 75 in a 55 in my cage , i had the opportunity to listen to some of the creative excuses offered the judge by others after listening to a number of well , i was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up versions , i decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some he was less than impressed with any of them this young , rather burley looking guy , had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking ohio state highyway patrol trooper he was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone it was also noted that the defendant \( motorcycle rider \) had alcohol on his breath , but was not cited for this offence the judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice well son , those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle what do you have to say for your self \? well sir , meekly the defenant replied , i just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and i was on my way home he offered nothing more or less just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home the judge moved by the simplicity of the response , fined him the maximum in this case \( plus court costs of course \) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school is n't america great \? \?

19	burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go , given the waco bunch had other choices but it reminded me of the russian old believers who , thinking the antichrist was coming in 1666 , grew frantic when peter the great started westernizing russia and reforming the russian church a few years later they locked themselves in their churches and burned themselves alive by the thousands are there other cases of apocalypse obsessed christians resorting to self imolation \? is there a history of precedents \?
15	for src in most languages , the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch , or pasque , or some variation thereof , a word which comes from the hebrew pesach , meaning passover in english , german , and a few related languages , however , it is known as easter , or some variation thereof , and questions have been asked about the origin of this term one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum 1 5 , where he derives the word from the name of an anglo saxon goddess of spring called eastre bede is a great scholar , and it is natural to take his word for it but he lived 673 735 , and augustine began preaching in kent in 597 the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with it seems likely that his derivation is just a guess , based on his awareness that there had been an anglo saxon goddess of spring bearing that name , and the resemblance of the words thus , if the said resemblance \( surely it is not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn \) is not in istelf convincing , the testimony \( or rather the conjecture \) by bede does not make it more so assuming that bede was right , that would not justify saying that the christian celebration \( which , after all , had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it \) has pagan roots it would simply mean that the anglo saxons , upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring , called it by the name that to them meant simply spring festival however , bede 's is not the only theory that has been proposed j knoblech , in die sprach , zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft 5 \( vienna , 1959 \) 27 45 , offers the following derivation among latin speaking christians , the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as hebdomada alba \( white week \) , since the newly baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week sometimes the week was referred to simply as albae translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of alba , meaning dawn they accordingly rendered it as eostarum , which is old high german for dawn this gave rise to the form easter in english yours , james kiefer

17	fete \? \? \? since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive joyous events , your misuse of it here is rather unsettling i certainly abhor those israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the palestinians gazans given that , however , there is no comparison between the reality of the warsaw ghetto and in gaza just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying entity to maintain order , especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure ironically , international law recognizes each of these focusses \( that of the occupied and the occupier \) even though they are inherently in conflict israel certainly cannot , and should not , continue its present policies towards gazan residents there is , however , a third alternative the creation and implementation of a jewish dhimmi system with gazans palestinians as benignly protected citizens would you find that as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to islam 's policies towards its minorities \? it is a race , then \? between israel 's anti palestinian gazan final solution and the arab world 's anti israel jewish final solution do you favor one \? neither \? since there is justifiable worry by various parties that israel and arab palestinian final solution intentions exist , is n't it important that both israeli and palestinian gazan rights be secured \?

12	in four replies , i 've seen no hard numbers , so here goes for traces on the outside \( not inner layers \) , expect , in 1 oz copper , at 15 amps , the following temperature rises versus width this is from sams' reference data for engineers , seventh edition , pg 5 30 , which claims in turn to be from mil std 275c width temp rise inches degrees c 125 100 15 75 17 60 20 45 24 30 33 20 at 10 amps , the rise for the 125 width is only about 30 degrees power goes as square of the current , plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up certainly 20 \( 5mm \) traces should be ample for what you want to do and 2 ounce copper almost cuts the required width in half \( i 'd do 2 oz at about 0 08 width myself , i think given that the rated current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition \)
16	moreover , the batf has admitted having agents in the compound , and as far as i have been able to ascertain , those agents were still in the compound when the first shots were fired for all we know , these two people may be the agents , who would certainly be unlikely to stay around and cook with the faithful assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all maybe i sound paranoid , but i watched janet reno last night harping on how much david koresh was a big , bad child abuser , and i kept wondering why she much less batf wanted us to infer that she had any jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place i'm positive that the sealed warrant is not for child abuse what was it for \? peobably weapons violations janet reno did n't say word one last night about weapons violations why \? because she knows that such a case is no longer believable \?

several segmentation faults when running x note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or vax platforms here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values , so when gcc compiled parts of x are linked with sun supplied functions that pass or return structs , run time errors occur affected programs include rgb and the server this is from the gcc manual on the sparc , gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for structures it passes them by including their contents in the argument list , whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference this really ought to be fixed , but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc , so it is n't straightforward to fix it the convention for structure returning is also incompatible , and ` fpcc struct return' does not help you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags files which need to be compiled using cc include server os 4 2bsd oscolor c rgb rgb c in addition , several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values clients xhost xhost c clients xauth gethost c calls to

building with shared libraries on a sun , remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries \( if you 've installed x on a file server , run it on the server 's clients , too \) while building and installing the distribution , you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have \( e g those distributed with openwindows \) you should make sure you do not have ld library path set in your environment during the build or the installation if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs , please note that the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib , usr local lib , or usr 5lib for these programs to work \( or else those programs must be linked statically \) courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts , however , to use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir

\) running under sunos 4 1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries to avoid the problem , do one of these 1 \) make the program non setuid you should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources \( e g ptys and dev kmem \) used by these programs , to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site 2 \) relink the

note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs mounted disks xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem subject 104 \) how do i get around the frame buffer security

ca \) 2 93 subject 105 \) topic building x programs subject 106 \) what is imake \? imake is not a replacement for the make program instead , it is a makefile generator that takes advantages of the include file and macro processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not specific to x , the x release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve , in part because the process by which the system specific configuration files , system independent configuration files , and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not obvious there have been several different versions of imake the r3 , r4 , and r5 versions are different you can obtain information on imake from these sources the r4 and r5 release notes and imake man page include information on using imake to build x

can i get imake \? versions are distributed with the r4 and r5 releases an earlier version is distributed with the x11r3 release some third party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files there are no real standards for such configuration files , although most current contributed software expects the templates distributed with x11r5 export contains the r5 distribution unpacked , so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution a stand alone version of imake , but one stemming from x11r5 , is in ftp germany eu net pub x11 misc imake imake pure tar z \( 192 76 144 75 \) subject 108 \) i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do \? if you have r4 or r5 installed on your system , run xmkmf this is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make , which will use that new makefile to compile the program subject 109 \) why ca n't i link to the xlib shape routines \? when i try to compile certain programs , i get the following link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x \( shape \) which was introduced in the mit x11r4 distribution and allows non rectangular windows like the other sample server extensions , the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it pre x11r4 servers , as well as many vendor supplied servers , do not support the shape extension , in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway in order to use the shape extension , you must link to the library libxext a in the x11r4 distribution , this library and the associated includes will be in the mit extensions directory if you do not have these files , do not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor supplied x libraries from john b melby , melby yk fujitsu co jp uunet uu net , 3 91 subject 110 \) what are these problems with xtinherit not found on the sun \? when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 4 0 3 or 4 1 machine i get the error ld so symbol not found xtinherit what you are seeing is a side effect of a kludge in the r4 libxt a to get sun shared libraries working apparently , you ca n't share a function that is both called and compared , as xtinherit is this was handled by putting xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used , thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded that is , in initialize c , where xttoolkitinitialize \( \) and xtinitialize \( \) reside these routines would normally be called you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xt based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize \( \) anywhere 1 \) it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a connection to the x server osf motif 's 1 1 0 uil had this problem it called xtmalloc \( \) and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your program the function does not have to be executed , just linked in 2 \) alternatively , your program does n't need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize \( \) it may be an xlib or xview program in this case , you can remove lxt from your link command it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically , although this

were several name changes in the athena widget set \( in addition to the header files moving into x11 xaw \) these are mentioned in the r4 release notes in this case , these functions are not really xt functions but are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw 10 90 subject 112 \) topic programming problems and puzzles subject 113 \) why does n't my program get the keystrokes i select for \( sic \) \? the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another in order to get keystrokes , your program must ask the window manager for the input focus to do this , you must set up what are called hints for the window manager if your applications is xlib based , you can use something like the following xwmhints wmhints wmhints flags inputhint wmhints input true xsetwmhints \( dpy , window , wmhints \) if your application is based on the xt intrinsics , you can set the xtninput resource to be true \( as you probably want to in any case \) if you do n't have source , you can start up the application with the resource ' input true' certain window managers , notably dxwm and olwm , are very picky about having this done if you are using sun 's openwindows olwm , you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that are n't icccm compliant openwindows focuslenience true mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun subject 114 \) how do i figure out what window manager is running \? you ca n't reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case for most cases , you should n't care which window manager is running , so long as you do things in an icccm conformant manner there are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively , it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features \( such as olwm 's push pin menus \) in order to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window manager 's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility problems subject 115 \) is there a skeleton x program available \? there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development in x , the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut paste on existing x applications good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just this one little thing include contrib clients xskel , a simple r4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks , the xaw examples in the examples directory in the r3 and r4 distributions , and the xlib hello world example in the r3 doc helloworld and r4 doc tutorials helloworld an updated version of this program which uses r4 xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 2 90 to comp windows x by glenn widener of tektronix 3 90 in addition , a sample xt program \( for xaw or xm \) by rainer klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export lcs mit edu in contrib mdisp tar z 4 92 subject 116 \) why does xtgetvalues not work for me \( sic \) \? the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this arg args 3 int i int sensitive oops wrong data type i 0 xtsetarg \( args i , xtnsensitive , sensitive \) i xtgetvalues \( widget , args , i \) but xtnsensitive is a boolean , which on most machines is a single byte declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource , as it appears in the widget 's man page 11 90 subject 117 \) why do n't xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work \? you 're probably trying to use these functions from application code they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising functions , xtmakegeometryrequest \( \) and xtmakeresizerequest \( \) , are also for use only by widgets , in this case by a child to request a change from its parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources although this will result in the widget internal functions' being called , your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow \( \) and xresizewindow \( \) should similarly be avoided they should n't be used to change xtnx , xtny , xtnwidth , or xtnheight subject 118 \) why is n't there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow \? although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult , the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves \? what should happen to the widget 's children \? and by the time such semantics are defined , there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources , as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit david b lewis faq craft

12	aaahh a problem very near and dear to my heart in our case , other monitors cause this problem the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem this sounds like your problem since flourescent lites , motors , etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it , but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor fusebox on other side of wall maybe \? we started spec'ing panasonic ct 1331y video monitors \( 3 switchable input lines \( vid aud \) s vhs on one \) 400 this stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it now on to your problem you need what is known as mu shielding \( very common , in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type o 'scopes \) i talked to a ee prof he said get a coffee can , cut both ends off , mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor be careful to avoid all high voltage circuitry especially the thicker high voltage anode lead usually colored red if you kill yourself , do n't blame sue me ! ! ! use plastic or other non conducting stand offs and such to mount can now , i would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out , so hopefully this 'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well if not , start shielding those other sources
11	clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption currently , when you send an encrypted message , an opponent can usually tell 1 \) that you are using encryption 2 \) which encryption method you are using because that information is usually in the clear with clipper , most opponents will only know that you are sending clipper text , they wo n't know that your clipper text is itself encoded only those few opponents who get your clipper keys will know that your message is double encrypted kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box so , do n't just think of replacements for clipper , also think of front ends carl

19	john 12 24 26 most assuredly , i say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies , it remains alone but if it dies , it produces much grain he who loves his life will lose it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life if anyone serves me , let him follow me and where i am , there my servant will be also if anyone serves me , him my father will honor why would i want an eternal life if i hate this one \? if we were created by a deity , why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us \? why would i want to live forever \? the challenge in my life is that i will die , and that i must give my life the meaning i wish it to have before that happens my time is here and will someday pass i will be content to live on in the memories of my friends , and once they too are dead , then i will no longer have any reason to exist in short even if your deity does exist , that does n't automatically mean that i would worship it i am content to live my own life , and fend for myself , so when i die , i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up , it will be because of my actions and my choices if your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this , then so be it i would much rather just cease to exist but if your god wants my respect and my obedience , then it had better earn these and if it does , then they will be very strong and true jesus was n't the only one who rose from the dead i think it was osiris who did the same , as well as a few characters from greek or norse legend , if memory serves but still why would i want to rise from the dead \? why do you want to \? if your god wants to win my devotion , then it knows what it can do provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion that 's precisely it i neither see nor know zeus either , nor odin shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesus \? you 've got to understand my point of view i see christians spouting bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition truth is , it 's not robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply he just rattles them off day by day some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality , and i point these out where i can but even more than that , even when christians do try to explain the verses in their own words , they do so from a christian point of view , which is that every human being would want to be a christian if only he or she understood the christian message properly , and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end here 's the problem with that substitute moslem or buddhist or satanist instead of christian , and it means the same thing christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book but if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the real world , you 've got some convincing to do and in my opinion , you 're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there are n't any , and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life as long as you keep your beliefs to yourself , i 'll keep my beliefs to myself but as soon as you start waving them around , expect me to toss in my opinions , too

19	there were many injustices in the middle ages and this is truely sad i would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality , or any other crime the church is not called to take over the governments of the world it may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today , but that does not mean that we should teach christians to practice homosexual immorality do you think that we should also teach christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted and you accuse me of judging \? when did you look into my heart and see if i have love i have been writing that we should not teach christians to practice homosexual immorality , and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart i ca n't say that i love homosexuals as i should i ca n't say that i love my neighbor as i should either i do n't know very many homosexuals as it is but jesus loves homosexuals , just as he loves everyone else if his love were conditional , i not know him at all yes we should show love to homosexuals , but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to stumble and continue in their sin that is a very damaging and dangerous thing that is slander i could just as easily say that nambla has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal , and that this is what you are embracing i do believe that homosexual sex is immoral , that does not mean i endorse using violence against them there is a problem of hatred in the church but there is also the problem of what has been called unsanctified mercy many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon , and have gotten militant in the flesh this is truely sad yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society , and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from jesus but we should n't water down the gospel to draw people in jesus did n't go out of his way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in he told one man to sell all he had he told another not to say good bye to his family his words were hard at times we should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction many people have already been innoculated to the gospel link hudson

13	i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly , \( motrin at the time \) , i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally do n't take nsaids or tylenol for headaches , because i 've found them to be ineffective however , i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids \( currently naprosyn \) first , is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period , and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past \( 12 years ago \) , so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i 've tried synarel , it reduced the pain while i took it \( 3 mos \) , but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i do n't expect to have any more children , i do n't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed \( the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis \) one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i'm left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn \( or something similar but not aspirin , that does n't work , and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago , so i'm through with it \) in fact , naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain \( and pain in both legs \) as i 'll discuss in a moment generally though , i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn , but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain \( it 's actually quite effective at reducing the pain , it just takes quite a while \) in the meantime i'm frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i 've had mris , xrays , ct scan , and emgs \( i 've had 2 of them , and do n't intend to ever do that again \) with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging , degeneratig disks , and from the xrays \( and mri , i think \) it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations \( l3 l4 , and l4 l5 \) , but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah , i had some other horrible test , called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway , the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time , but i can live with it when the leg pain is there , i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for 6 9 months \( every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse , so i 'd always resume \) since last november i have taken it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months \( 2 3 times a week \) after the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction \( she had tried it earlier , but it had caused a lot of pain in my back , this time she tried it at a lower weight \) after a month or two , the pain in my legs began going away \( but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage \) so now , i do n't have nearly as much pain in my legs , in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches , i really ca n't avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources , that force me to use them \( oh , i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery , but i'm avoiding that too \) i find the migraines difficult to deal with , occassionally i have to take off work , but usually i can work , but at a reduced capacity \( i'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing \) when the pelvic pain is bad , i ca n't concentrate much , i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes , because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad , it can cause severe burning in both legs , shooting pains in my legs , electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes , and basically when it gets bad i ca n't really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines , the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1 3 days i 've taken cafergot \( the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage \) , but i do n't like the side effects \( if i take more than two i get diahrea \) if i get a very bad headache , i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist was n't very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot , he said that when sumatriptan becomes available , i should try that i 've tried several other medications \( fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal \) but they either did n't work , or i could n't tolerate them so what can i do \? my doctor 's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain , which i agree with most of the time , but not when i have a lot of pain i 've had some bad experiences with surgery \( my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine \) , and i 've already had surgery several times anyway , the point of what i'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines , some people need to take them to tolerate other pain

15	andrew , how i wish this were true , and how i long for the day in which it will be true but alas , it is not true of history the bible does not have a message it has messages and some of those are messages of repentance and giving , to turn the other cheek , and do unto the least of these but some of the messages are the complete opposite like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle , and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job like jews who are said to have cried out in matthew , his blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads a verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust have these been misunderstood \? i think not they have only been understood too clearly it is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches , the meek carpenter from nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be , his teachings we must take to heart , but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it to say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone instead we must let the text critique the text understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus , we test all things and hold fast to that which is good at the risk of sounding heretical \( well ok , more heretical \) i do n't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness , it is something which requires introspection and reflection if that is a sin , then there can be no salvation , for doubt is an inescapble part of being human consider job his friends had no doubt whereas job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of god when god finally did appear he rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them to be a christian it to always have doubt , or not to have honesty

15	stuff deleted for brevity your very starting point is wrong christianity is not based on following a moral standard for it is by grace you have been saved , through faith not by works so that no man may boast \( eph 2 7 8 \) you say that you know the bible well , and can recognize \( do you mean recite \? \) many passages from memory that could very well be so however , it looks like there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to \( titus 3 5 and james 2 10 are among them \) obedience to the moral law is imporant however , it is supposed to be the result of turning your life over to christ and becoming a christian it is by no means the starting point

10	1992 93 los angeles kings notes and game reports kings 6 calgary flames 3 04 18 93 the third place kings opened the 1993 stanley cup playoffs in calgary , against the second place flames and came out with an impressive 6 3 victory in front of a non sellout crowd of 18 , 605 at the saddledome in calgary symthe division playoff hockey this was both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the kings scored off the opening face off the kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the flames as they played out standing team defense it took the flames 9 45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal the kings , ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing , shut down the flames the flames went 0 8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities the kings had their problems on the power play , yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries the kings forwards back checked while the defense stood the flames up at the blue line , allowing the kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the flames rob blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex pected to be in the lineup on wednesday wayne gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg he took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game interviewed on the radio this morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on wednesday 1st period 1 0 the kings got things started right off the opening face off gretzky won the draw with the puck going to sydor he crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the flames zone and behind the net the puck carried around to the far side where robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to sandstrom he put the puck behind the flames net where gretzky picked it up gretzky set up in 'his office' , moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where sydor had moved in sydor , who got the puck between the face off dot and the hash mark , shot off the pass , beating vernon low and between the legs millen and fleury went off at 4 57 skrudland went off at 12 25 but the kings failed to convert carson went off at 14 53 and the flames failed to convert dahlquist went off at 18 34 and dahl went off at 19 30 , giving the kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert the kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period 2nd period the kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on with 6 seconds left in the 5on4 , vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game 1 1 calgary evened the score on the ensuing kings power play kurri , with the puck in the neutral zone , tried to put the puck into the flames zone but it hit the stick of fleury and bounced to suter at the flames blue line suter skated down the near wing and into the kings zone he faked a shot at the circle and skated around kurri as he cut thorugh the crease , he got hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind hrudey , on his stick side for a short hander 2 1 the kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play shuchuk , in the far circle passed to sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net sydors shot hit shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 kings \( shuchuk and granato \) were being checked by 3 flames carson came from the far corner , picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of vernon from 5 feet above the crease 3 1 the kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later rychel was checked off the puck at the flames blue line taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to huddy huddy shot off the pass , from the near face off dot , beating a diving vernon on the glove side 4 1 2 59 later , the kings had a 3 goal lead mcsorley took a shot form the near point that hit a flame and deflected towards the boards marty got his own rebound , skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of vernon skrudland went off at 10 53 but the kings could not convert sydor went off at 12 35 and watters went off at 14 40 , giving the flames a 5 second 5 3 but they failed to convert mcsorley went off at 17 19 and the flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the flames killed it themselves when suter went off for high sticking at 17 31 sandstrom went off at 18 03 to close out the period the kings hit 3 goal post in the period 3rd period the kings used the phrase initiate , not retaliate and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the kings continued to pound the body and the flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game 5 1 the kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 06 mark the kings shot the puck into the near corner of the flames zone vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it donnelly , who was behind him , wacked at the puck , sending it into the low slot as vernon slid back in to the crease , granato got a shot that hit a flame and bounced to the left of the net where millen fired the rebound behind vernon sydor went off at 1 24 nieuwendyk went off at 3 22 as the teams skated 4 on 4 5 2 otto , skating down the far side , stepped around mcsorley , cut to the net and passed to dahlquist in the low slot dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving hrudey carson and rychel came in on a 2 1 when carson passed across to rychel , fleury tripped rychel with no call the puck got shoveled into the far corner where fleury knocked rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards , drawing a 5 minute major and a game misconduct at the 6 08 mark unfortunately , the kings squandered the 5 minute power play when granato \( at 6 44 \) and watters \( at 8 19 \) took penalties 5 3 the flames closed to within 2 at the 8 47 mark macinnis , at the near point , passed to yawney at the far point he took a few strides towards the net , wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of hrudey the play started on another faceoff that the kings lost timeout la 6 3 macinnis took a penalty at 9 56 and the kings converted on the power play to seal the victory sandstrom , skating down the far wing in the flames zone cut towards the back of the net just as he crossed the goal line , he passed the puck into the low slot , on the far side , to carson who shot off the pass , beating vernon on the ice , stick side at the 16 17 mark , skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he went after shuchuk stern wound up with a double minor for roughing , a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct , and he took the flames right out of the game on the plus side the kings , for the most part , played very disciplined hockey as they let calgary retaliate the kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing on the minus side the kings lost almost every face off this must improve or the flames will surely get that power play back on track notes the kings recalled guy leveque , brandy semchuk and jim thomson from phoenix wayne gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point the kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against ,

17	april 13 , 1993 response by al moore \( l629159 lmsc5 is lmsc lockheed com \) basically the problem is that israel may remain , or leave , the occupied territories it cannot do both , it cannot do neither so far , israe continues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they leave why should either change their view \? it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction and in fact may be said to not be negotiating tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the first is that of israel , where there is little trust for arab groups , so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper , expectations , hopes , etc the second is that of the arab world palestinians , where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back given this , the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions by tangible is meant something that 1 \) provides israel with comparable protection \( from the land it is to give up \) , 2 \) in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively \( not just diplomatically \) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory \( by citizens or visitors \) in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to co existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above , how could such guarantees be instilled \? for example , how could such guarantees controls be added to the palestinian pisga proposals \? israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go \( gives lands back to arab states , no more buffer zone , gives full autonomy to palestinians \) , any and or all of the arab parties could \( and would , if not controlled somehow \) easily return to the traditional anti israel position the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen

13	the following is from a critique of a 60 minutes presentation on msg which was aired on november 3rd , 1991 the critique comes from the tufts diet and nutrition letter , february 1992 edited for brevity chances are good that if you watched '60 minutes' last november 3rd 1991 , you came away feeling msg is bad for you in the segment entitled 'no msg , ' for instance , show host ed bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them \( 'millions are suffering a host of symptoms , and some get violently sick' \) peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony and speaks of studies on msg that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in order to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that msg , a flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items , causes headaches what he does not make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits one of the researchers who conducted the study , pharmacologist patricia williams , ph d , says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it 'but , ' she explains , 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem ' a second lapse comes with mention of dr john olney , a professor at the washington university school of medicine who , mr bradley remarks , 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters' because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr olney 's research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human youngsters in fact , only under extreme circumsrtances did dr olney 's experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected extremely high doses of msg into rodents , completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly , and when he used tubes to force feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach of course , neither of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg with food and most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine , so that very little reaches the bloodstream much to little , in fact , for human blood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in dr olney 's lab animals the world health organization appears to be very much aware of that fact and so does the european communities' scientific committee for food both , after examining numerous studies , have concluded that msg is safe their determination makes sense , considering that msg has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it headaches , swelling , a tightness in the chest , and a burning sensation , among others in fact , the most fail safe of clinical studies , the double blind study , has consistently exonerated the much maligned substance that 's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate , glutamate , enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein the reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein , glutamic acid , is broken down into glutamate during digestion it 's a breakdown that occurs frequently glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet it makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods , 20 percent in milk , 25 percent in corn , and 29 percent in whole wheat that does n't mean it 's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefore sensitive to it the consensus reached by large , international professional organizations is that msg is safe , the same consensus reached by the fda and the biomedical community at large

17	dr goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed i have been observing that 'poly' has been practicing goebels' rule quite loyally 'poly 's audience is mostly made of greeks who are not allowed to listen to turkish news however , in today 's informed world greek propagandists can only fool themselves for instance , those who lived in 1974 will remember the tv news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the american newspapers of july and august 1974 to find out what really happened there are in turkiye the greek hospital , the greek girls' lycee alumni association , the principo islands greek benevolent society , the greek medical foundation , the principo greek orphanage foundation , the yovakimion greek girls' lycee foundation , and the fener greek men 's lycee foundation as for greece , the longstanding use of the adjective 'turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers' association , the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace such community associations had been active until 1984 but they were first told to remove the word 'turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down this is also the final verdict \( november 4 , 1987 \) of the greek high court in the city of komotini , a former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage , was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal , just for saying outloud that he was of turkish descent this duly elected ethnic turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle , used by the greek governments , to cover up their inferiority complex they display , vis a vis , the people of turkiye the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term 'turks , ' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'muslims ' the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people , whom all the three nations \( bulgarians , turks , and greeks \) consider as part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements \? poor 'poly ' it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece talk about oppression in addition , in 1980 the 'democratic' greek parliament passed law no 1091 , virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts they have ceased to be self supporting religious and cultural entities talk about fascism the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus , irrespective of the will of the turkish minority , as state official although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece , the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders talk about democracy the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini such destruction , which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage , is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the 'so called' greek constitution , which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments the government of greece , on the other hand , is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region and you pondered sidiropoulos , the president of the macedonian human rights committee , became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the macedonian minority a forestry official by occupation , sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of kefalonia , hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina his employer , the florina city council , asked him to depart in 24 hours the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in copenhagen he returned to florina by his own choice and remains without a job helsinki watch , a well known human rights group , had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece in august 1990 , their findings were published in a report titled 'destroying ethnic identity turks of greece ' the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities it says for instance , the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini such destruction , which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage , is a violation of the lausanne convention the turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik were attacked , and tombstones were broken the cemetery in karotas was razed by bulldozers shall i go on \?

15	09 apr 93 , susan harwood kaczmarczik writes to all we suspect that 's because one party to the \( environmental \) dispute thinks the earth is sanctified it 's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the religious left , a secular , or even pagan fanaticism that now worships such gods as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions \( emphasis mine \) shk first of all , secular and pagan are not synonyms pagan , which is shk derived from the latin paganus , means of the country it is , in shk fact , a cognate with the italian paisano , which means peasant shk paganism , among other things , includes a reverence for the planet and shk all life on the planet stemming from the belief that all life is shk interconnected so , rather than be something secular , it is something shk very sacred i would go further , and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview , or by the humanist worldview , and especially by the secular humanist worldview this is not to say that all secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment , and i am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment but at the time of the renaissance and ref ormation in western europe man became the centre , or the focus of culture \( hence humanism \) this consciousness was also secular , in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age , r ather than the age to come capitalism arose at the same time , and the power of economics became central in philosophy this does n't mean that economics did not exist before , simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of western european society and its offshoots this cultural shift was , in its later stages , accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them there was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of economics from the christian view of man as the economos , the steward , of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers there were denominational differences among the new worshippers of mammon for some the name of the deity was the free rein of the market mechanism , while for others it was the dialectical forces of history but in both the capitalist west and the socialist east the environment was sacrificed on the altar of mammon the situation was mitigated in the west because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case steve
11	the only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back door what else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number \? to generate the unit key for a serial number n , the 30 bit value n is first padded with a fixed 34 bit block to produce a 64 bit block n1 s1 and s2 are then used as keys to triple encrypt n1 , producing a 64 bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly , n is padded with two other 34 bit blocks to produce n2 and n3 , and two additional 64 bit blocks r2 and r3 are computed r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 , r2 , and r3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits the first 80 bits are assigned to u1 and the second 80 bits to u2 the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies
17	i have read just today two articles dripping of hate and offence to a great deal of people i could find as much matching hatred in your articles as i have found in some of the self righteous kill in the name of god people i do n't know why you are so attcaking to everyone , is it a reaction to the hatred calls on this newsgroup , or is it a reaction to hardships you have seen and experienced from before i have learnt not to judge people by only what they say , but rather try to put myself in their place and aspire to understand their feelings i hope you would be able to do the same with everyone , starting by your ownself , because only through that you could be able to understand your feelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt thanks for your time

18	the white house office of the press secretary \( pittsburgh , pennslyvania \) for immediate release april 17 , 1993 radio address to the nation by the president pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh , pennsylvania 10 06 a m edt the president good morning my voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in america , kdka in pittsburgh i'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs , health care and the economy but i wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the american people i'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year 's presidential elections over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people , from whistle stop tours to fire side chats to the bus tour that i adopted , along with vice president gore , in last year 's campaign every saturday morning i take this time to talk with you , my fellow americans , about the problems on your minds and what i'm doing to try and solve them it 's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable you sent me to washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle down economics you know how important it is for us to make bold , comprehensive changes in the way we do business we live in a competitive global economy nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers , the competitiveness of their companies , the imagination of their industries , and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business , labor and government although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth , they 've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored that 's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind we have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs we 've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years , and we do n't have much to show for it we know that wages of most working people have stopped rising , that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care but we also know that , given the right tools , the right incentives and the right encouragement , our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live in many critical products today americans are the low cost , high quality producers our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs just two months ago i gave congress my plan for long term jobs and economic growth it changes the old priorities in washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be on people 's real needs , on increasing investments and jobs and education , on cutting the federal deficit , on stopping the waste which pays no dividends , and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future these new directions passed the congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country then the jobs plan i presented to congress , which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs , most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994 , passed the house of representatives it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate but it 's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the senate , just 43 senators they blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs the issue is n't politics the issue is people millions of americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it , counting on us in washington but the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock i know the american people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual i know they do n't want us to spin or wheels they want the recovery to get moving so i have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile yesterday i offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent from 16 billion to 12 billion it 's not what i 'd hoped for with 16 million americans looking for full time work , i simply ca n't let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people the mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward by taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon , i think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals first , we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs , including highway and road construction , summer jobs for young people , immunization for children , construction of waste water sites , and aid to small businesses we also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits , for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy is n't creating jobs second , i 've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across the board by a little more than 40 percent and third , i 've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing 200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people i'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it now , the people who are filibustering this bill the republican senators say they wo n't vote for it because it increases deficit spending , because there 's extra spending this year that has n't already been approved that sounds reasonable , does n't it \? here 's what they do n't say this program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five year budget , and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the congress this year it 's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending , and much of it was not designed to put the american people to work this is not about deficit spending we have offered a plan to cut the deficit this is about where your priorities are on people or on politics keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar it is paid for by budget cuts and it 's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children i urge all americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program to consider again the benefits for all of us when we 've helped make more american partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy you know , if every american who wanted a job had one , we would n't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today this bill is not a miracle , it 's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again but it 's a step we ought to take and it is fully paid for over the life of our budget tell your lawmakers what you think tell them how important the bill is if it passes , we 'll all be winners good morning , and thank you for listening
9	oh , yeah dave winfield marginal player guy did n't hit a lick , had negligible power , was a crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield , now entering his \( i believe \) 20th big league season , is still a damn decent hitter admittedly , his defense has slipped a great deal , but in his prime , he had a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i do n't know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players kingman was a one dimension power hitter he could n't field , he ran like an anvil , hit for a low average \( though , if i remember right , his obp was n't that hideous \) , and \( for those who consider such things important \) was a absolute primo dick eddie murray \? yup , only the best 1st baseman of the 80 's i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots , but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in 1983 , it seems that he was n't overrated by the media lee smith \? hmmmm this one 's actually pretty close he 's had a s solid , dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \( wrigley , fenway \) i 'd have to take a closer look at the stats \( it 's been a while \) , but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers , simply racking up a lot of saves does n't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch , too simply because minnesota and boston and \( for a month \) atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one , the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof , imho darrell evans \? nice career , actually a bit underrated \( kinda like ted simmons , imho \) , but not a hof'er lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game is n't marginal \? now , wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop his defense was so good that he 's won something along the lines of 10 gold gloves again , gold gloves are mediot biased , and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie 's more recent awards , but usually , this is tempered by someone else in the early 80 's getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozzie 's offense , you ask \? good obp , great speed numbers , in a park which , for most of his career , depressed offense , admittedly , no power \( 'cept against tom niedenfuer \) , but still , a definite asset offensively yount \? 3 , 000 hits , mvp at two different positions , uh huh , a real stiff his '82 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory , and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks , as far as ss numbers go he 's a clear hof'er , imho well , as far as garvey goes , you 're right garvey is a mediot candidate , pushed because of his winning attitude \( a minor factor , if one at all \) , and his great defense \( no errors , admittedly , but the range of a tree stump \) garvey should n't be in the hof skyjack \? i 've said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so , but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris' ability to win which is nothing more than morris' ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point , morris is an average pitcher \( although from his early returns in '93 , he may be damned close to done \) but , in all fairness , morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80 's for up and down tiger teams while 1984 was \( obviously \) a great year for detroit , the rest of the decade , the team was generally in contention , but not favorites morris' career numbers are quite good , and worthy of hof consideration ryan \? of course , but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time after all , nolan never won a cy damn , he 's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years his w l record is mediocre \( of course , nolan 's a hof'er \) puck \? probably , although he 's got to play reasonably well for a few more years \( 10 years , even good ones , are n't enough to make the hof , most likely \) that said , i believe puckett will make the hof , pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out \( barring something really tragic or sudden \) he 's very popular in the media and with fans , and legitimately has been one of the best cf 's in the game since he joined the league i 've always liked the guy , and i hope he does make it and , in the end , i think the puck will make it in but , really , it 's too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net , and , believe it or not , i never tire of it it 's an interesting subject here 's an off the top of my head list of potential hof'ers from each team i probably left a couple of guys off , so feel free to follow up i wo n't consider anyone who started playing after about 1985 \( again , too early to tell \) note these are all active players , i'm not counting recent retirees baltimore cal ripken \( should be a lock by now , even if gehrig 's record stands \) boston roger clemens \( might be a lock already , which is amazing \) , dawson \( \? \) detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker \( possibilities \) milwaukee robin yount \( discussed earlier \) new york wade boggs \( possibly \) , mattingly \( long shot \) toronto paul molitor and jack morris \( possibilities \) kansas city george brett \( lock \) minnesota kirby \( too early to tell \) , winfield \( lock \) oakland eckersley \( lock \) , mcgwire \( too early \) , rickey \( lock \) , welch \( long shot \) texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange \) cubs sandberg \( lock \) st louis ozzie \( lock \) , lee smith \( probably \) new york murray \( almost a lock \) , saberhagen \( obviously , he 's got to regain past form \) and most certainly , not vince coleman , despite what he 'll tell you \) los angeles butler , strawberry , and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn \( pretty good shot \) colorado dale murphy \( a good shot \) , ryan bowen \( just to see if you 're awake \) before i get flames this is an off the top of the head list , there 's probably a few deserving candidates that i left off , and , i did n't include barry bonds , will clark , any atlanta starting pitcher , frank thomas , canseco , mcgriff , etc because i only considered guys who started playing before 1985 \) e mail or post , i almost fear what i may have started here

3 next 4 silicon graphics 5 ibm rs 6000 6 other stuff 1 spoofing a keyboard over the serial port if you 've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard \( sun , hp , dec , etc \) then you 're going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard if your workstation runs the x window system , you 're in luck you can buy a cheap used pc , hook your expensive keyboard up to it , and run a serial cable to your workstation then , run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events the two main programs i 've found to do this are kt and a2x a2x is a sophisticated program , capable of controlling the mouse , and even moving among widgets on the screen it requires a server extension \( xtest , dec xtrap , or xtestextension1 \) to find out if your server can do this , run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list if your server does n't have this , you may want to investigate compiling x11r5 , patchlevel 18 or later , or bugging your vendor kt is a simpler program , which should work with unextended x servers another program called xsendevent also exists , but i have n't seen it both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda berkeley edu 2 x terminals also , a number of x terminals \( ncd , tektronics , to name a few \) use pc compatible keyboards if you have an x terminal , you may be all set try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard also , some x terminals add extra buttons you may need

11	from the limited details released so far , it seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography otherwise , the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable it probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call thats how they would identify the private key in their data base \? this means that either the nsa has developed some non rsa public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize pkp rsadsi the former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard if the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break rsa 's stranglehold on public key crypto in the u s as for my impressions of the whole scheme it seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto , they are trying to co opt it their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm more likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered anyone else notice that in their q a session , they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed they seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we 'll ban strong crypto outright \? i dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all \( legal \) ways possible

13	purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo clubbing , the difference being that with true clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally \( towards the fingertip \) with pseudo clubbing , the angle is initially positive , then negative , which is the normal situation real internists can talk for hours about clubbing i'm limited to a couple of minutes whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear , but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds supposedly , only true clubbing is associated with disease the problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long , and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia , it is very reasonable to get a chest xray however , many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization the cause of clubbing is unclear , but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination often , however , the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent

17	it is called 'the justice' we also demand that the x soviet armenian government admit its responsibility for the turkish and kurdish genocide , render reparations to the muslim people , and return the land to its rightful owners the recognition of the genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further , and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'arromdian' of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle \? if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power , to which no one could have opposed , today there would be no eastern problem but turks did not do so they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum thus , in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs , the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist , where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made and the barbarian \( ! \) turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians , could find asylum these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries 1 the turks , who are a conquering nation , did not turkify the nations that came under their rule instead , they respected their religions and traditions it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today \( popescu ciocanel \) turks rule over people under their administration only externally , without interfering with their internal structures on account of this , the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries 2 human beings hate each other on account of religious differences this flaw is older than islam and christianity but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too , or if it did not keep translating itself into action , many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy ! \( a de mortraye \) 3 turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition on the contrary , it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism if you look into history , you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years , and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians , especially that of the orthodoxes no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens , even today in turkey , however , if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities , local courts immediately take them under their protection in that vast and calm country of the sultan , all religions and nations are living together peacefully although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue , it does not replace them because of this , the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open air ceremonies of this sect , neither does any law imprison its cross in the church while the dead are being taken to the graves , a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations , chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners , a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of priests \( a ubicini \) 4 1 ah djevat , yabancilara gore eski turkler , 3rd ed \( istanbul , 1978 \) , pp 70 71 2 ibid , p 91 3 ibid , pp 214 215 4 ibid , pp 215 216 serdar argic

0	sorry , you 're right i did not clearly state it the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude once one has accepted the assumption that there is no god \( s \) , and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption \( s \) contradict your assumption , then i would say there 's a lack of consistency here now i know you 'll get on me about faith if the positive belief that god does not exist were a closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that logic \? but you , probably like me , seem to be a soft atheist sorry for the flamage \) what is the clipper project btw \? it might have appeared to attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it , be it cross or hammer sickle the stalin example is important not only because it 's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas , even after all that he had wrought first , all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will not sway most people , for they simply do not accept the analogy why \? one of the big reasons is that many , many people want something beyond this life you can pretend that they do n't want this , but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god can love as a truth be proven , logically \? john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all many christians i know also boast in this way , but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance of course , i do know arrogant christians , doctors , and teachers as well technically , you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant , jesus , for instance i speak against strong atheism i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective , just as , say , the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective no apology necessary \) bake timmons , iii

19	930418 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law honestly the word of sin is restriction would i kid you \? does one man 's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals \? quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order taken out of context , words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta , frater superior of the order to which i belong when he included that bit from merlinus x' he did us all a service he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor i have little knowledge regarding reuss' background , but surely he was an unusual man , and he was an important force in the order for many years yet as people change so do orders change , and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of o t o remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself , perhaps by testing the limits myself let us examine this issue a bit more closely in 1895 , karl kellner \( 1850 1905 \) , a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist , as well as a high grade mason , founded the ordo templi orientis kellner had traveled widely in the east , where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices kellner 's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann , heinrich klein and theodore reuss , who had worked together prior to joining the o t o the order was first proclaimed in 1902 in reuss 's masonic publication , 'oriflamme' on kellner 's death , reuss succeeded him as outer head o h o the 'jubilee' edition of the 'oriflamme' , published in 1912 , announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic theodore reuss was an interesting character born june 28 , 1855 in augsburg , he entered masonry in 1876 he was a singer , journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police , infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marx 's daughter and her husband reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott , a leader of the golden dawn , who later introduced him to john yarker yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites , reuss settled on the development of the o t o the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss' leadership for example , he chartered papus in france , rudolph steiner in berlin and h spencer lewis in the usa in 1912 , the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets when crowley looked at it afresh , the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world , and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor all was well until 1925 when the book of the law was translated into german there was a break in the continuity of the order manyk members split with the new o h o over the book , which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss 's request , deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation an introduction to the history of the o t o , by ad veritatem ix' within equinox iii 10 , edited by hymenaeus beta , frater superior , rex summus sanctissimus , caliph of the united states of america , published by samuel weiser , 1990 there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in equinox iii 10 and this is the real point , is it not \? why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization \? does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema \? or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers \? a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations it is quite easy for me to see , for example , that all of o t o derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry , purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph , whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema' is laughable at best would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way \? will i \? i think not why \? because my frater will see it as a perspective , an interjection i am using as an example my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus x' please look o t o more carefully i do not support reuss 's words myself , as i am not qualified to assess them , and i am critical of their pomposity if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so , then what can this say about the health of the order \? does it mean that the order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles \? or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own , not shackled by some dogmatic requirement \? how shall we resolve these two possibilities \? i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information they are quite often artists and geniuses having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area \( many who are or were very heavily involved with the order \) , i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moments i followed my intuition , and i 've found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different o t o body i'm happily participating in social groups \( feasts or initiations \) and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes this does n't make me an authority on order politics and explanations , however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far there are many ways to interpret words , and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread invoke me under my stars love is the law , love under will i am i !

0	you misrepresent me , selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said , by the way , is a christian , not a muslim regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half truths about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact , i may post some of it here \( if it is n't too long \) i have n't read lewis 's article , so i ca n't comment directly upon it , and have only spoken about his writings in general so far , that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti islamic polemics , as i understand it , are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half truths again , read orientalism by edward said i am not asking you to take what i say on trust , in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book \( it is a well known book \) and check the evidence out for yourself if slavery is in reality \( as opposed to in the practice of some muslims \) opposed by islam , then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i understand your point of view , selim i think , rather , it is us who are not getting through to you some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women , i have made posting after posting on this subject , showing that islam is not anti woman , etc however , have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them \? i just reposted a very good one , under the title islam and women , reposted from soc religion islam if this has already disappeared from your site , then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho , your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves , my posting on slavery the second one i made , which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year is based completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an and hadiths now , just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action , does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam , even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah \? no ! of course not let me give you a concrete example , which might help clarify this for you the qur'an prohibits drinking now , if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer , does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer \? of course not , and only an idiot would think so do you see my point \? you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist \( this does not mean that islam does not support a free market for it does in general but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it \) one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist , etc etc selim , i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think \( as you obviously do \) that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history , the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history , the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is , for example , anti education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam history shows that your conclusion is false and that , instead , there must be other reasons for this situation well , selim , your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur'an or not the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow , in your theory , it is by following the qur'an that muslims are backwards in education selim , it is your thesis that is anti historical , for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far , it seems to me that your view on islam being anti education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this i think , selim , you should consider taking your own advice here too selim , you have such conviction of your viewpoint , yet you demonstrate ignorance , not only of islam but also of islamic history \( particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so i think \) yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history ! selim , if i remember right , you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues , and start reading some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have
16	no the issue is reducing crime , not guns if gun control does n't lower crime overall , then is does n't address the issue does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common \? muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun , and rarely shoot their victim a mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him so , while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun , criminals are more likely to actually use the knife \( as opposed to threatening the victim with it \) it is n't at all clear that replacing the criminal 's gun with a knife would reduce murders stabbings might just become more common that 's why it is important to look at the overall \( not the with gun \) homicide rate it avoids the issue of substitution , different criminal techinques of using different weapons , etc and measures what we want to prevent murders face \? possibly however , facing knife welding attackers is n't too common stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic very few criminals shoot from cover it attracts to much attention and they do n't have a chance to go through your pockets overall , i 'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife actually , the exact same statement is true of guns training in unarmed self defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem you also ignore the criminal 's reaction the national crime survey clearly shows that criminals \( unarmed , armed with a knife , gun or whatever \) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation if faced with a serious threat , almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target therefore , using \( or threatening to use , as is much more commonly the case \) a weapon is the best defence against an attacker , regardless of how he is armed knives , however , are much less effective than guns criminals do n't consider knifes as a serious threat nearly as often as they do guns
18	an amazing illustration of disconnection from reality glad to see that you agree that the current government is reticent about admitting the sovereignty of the people ! speaking from personal experience , i have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after i demanded that the da prove such jurisdiction on the record , and the da stood mute i have also had an appellate court uphold such action and hide behind california rules of court , rule 106 \( the judges of the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in any cases decided by them , but may do so whenever they deem it advisable or in the public interest \) that is reality , i agree

15	i originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally , but decided to post the information i had on the topic i spoke to the pastor of my parish \( catholic \) recently , by coincidence , on this subject his explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest , it is important to have it recognized by the church as soon as it is possible because the church recoginizes itself as a community of believers , members of the church , to some degree , are to be held accountable to each other to be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island , there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis therefore , couples get married without the priest being present , but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area i remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community thus , married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married , as divorce sets a bad example for the community also , the couple has vowed to become one with one another the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one while couples may marry without witnesses , they may not get anulments without a priest present an anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not , in fact , a marriage at all , for whatever reason so do n't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half hour later ! ! i tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage , but i would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex , whether or not they intended to be married , assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act the couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents sex is a commitment , i believe , in god 's eyes but i'm digressing god be with you ,

5	a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation when he first logs on \( via xdm \) , he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running in this configuration , x windows applications \( particularly xdvi \) work fine however , if he opens up a second xterm application , suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window , giving the error unable to load iso 8859 1 font the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file , with prettier colours and other slight changes further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour , and more significant , all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window if i start the xterm with a different font \( using the fn option \) , no problems it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available , so there does n't appear to be a problem in the font directories hash tables other than rewriting the xterm app defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best , does anyone have any ideas \?

11	i wholeheartedly agree knowing that we have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the fifth amendment of our constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for self governance we have to take our government back from the self serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government we have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation that situation has to be changed allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the devil himself it 's a vicious cycle the law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities and having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property it 's also interesting to note that two months ago rush limbaugh said that clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control anytime a leader believes in that , the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more we have to take our government back otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high tech third world dictatorship we have to take responsibility for ourselves , our personal welfare , and our actions

14	i 've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i 've transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible , please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg , cheif of operations of rimsat , was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control , disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson \( \? \) went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there , he somehow ended up visiting the king , who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish , which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about 70 million , his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was , so at his suggestion , tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots while this is n't entirely off the wall , it was very unusual , seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program , and 31 is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard \( who is apparently a respected space lawyer \) wrote several opinions supporting tonga 's case eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots , ranging from 70 e to 170 e \( slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside \) according to sternberg , four of these , from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west , however , to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately 2 billion it 's not easy to raise that kind of money eventually , they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i do n't think i 'll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts , he was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually , rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of 150 million however , glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power , he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually , he worked out a deal and on dec 4 , 1992 he met with koptev , who heads the russian space program , to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware , npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia \( ca n't figure out how to spell the town , i need an atlas \) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers , honest people who team up to get things done , very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners \) sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partners it apparently costs the russians about 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west if you want to give them specifications , they 'll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using , costs run about 378 , 000 per transponder year this compares to 810 , 000 t y in the u s they can sell their time for about 1 1 million compared to 2 6 million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices , they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches , so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians , which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs , not big business because big business is just like what they have over there , except that we have better paper , both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months major investors in rimsat include russell 20 20 , which is a huge retirement fund organization , cellsat , which is a big telecom business in southeast asia , and a fund operated by some of the big names in u s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government every two weeks but we do n't worry because we 're used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments , putting 25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles to get around this , rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however , intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites , which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont \( horizon \) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years , while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years while this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites , sternberg downplayed the

19	\( lots of stuff about the nicene creed deleted which can be read in the original basenote i will also leave it up to other lds netters to take mr weiss to task on using mormon doctrine to declare the difinitive word on what the lds church teaches as doctrine hopefully the lds netters will be amiable in their explanation \) since it would do no good to rebut what mr weiss has stated on the origin of the nicene creed and its status as devine and inspired \( i say no good because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the creed were inspired \) , i leave you \( it will be some time before i post again \) with the following thought authored by eugene england , professor of english at brigham young university mr england wrote the following as part of a book review section in this people 's magazine \( spring 1993 edition \) i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon or human family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal , liberal or conservative \( christian or non christian hal 8 \) when we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american , then exclude those who do n't fit , it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good american might be one who does n't draw exclusive circles that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central american ideal is by excluding others and when we are tempted to draw a circle around mormon or christian , to decide who is orthodox and who is n't by how much they agree with us , it might be well to consider that the central pillar of christ 's orthodoxy is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family i recently spent some time in a christian bookstore in california the service was excellent , the clerks and customers all smiling , neat , and well scrubbed , and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries , sentimental fiction , and collections of evangelistic sermons but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others , often viciously whether the political left , our modern american culture , or other religions a whole section was devoted to cults and the occult , and as you might expect , mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment \( often by the same authors \) as satanism and i found i could either rent or buy \( in english or spanish \) copies of the god makers \( that absurdly inaccurate , even libelous , but very popular and dangerous anti mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the 1930s \) it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety \( perfect love casteth out fear , i john 4 18 \) i have always been pleased that the lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths , though i find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating and even threats of coercive action as the religious right wing has launched this year against the political left and american cultural and religious styles they do n't like it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked mormons people who would , if they had power , forcefully restrict mormons' rights along with those of others they believe to be evil the above sermon was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe to this people 's magazine , but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his arms even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel as in the days of christ , the church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the church i , for one , do not wish to be labelled christian , if those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent \( for example \) of the way my religion may interpret biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream christianity would give it once again , being in the majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice is louder that 's really all the critics of the lds church have to stand on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the lds church' interpretation ! using someone elses biased research of truths and non truths \( whose to say what the mixture is \?

15	do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith \? is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark \? are they clear or do you have doubts \? an important first step the realization that paul was human yes , and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best , very weak in the faith most could not read , most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form paul adapted the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market granted , this market still exists today , but do you count yourself as part of it \? to be weak in the faith is not missing the mark \( hamartia \) if you do the best that your education allows are you doing the best \? let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesis , exodus , leviticus , numbers , deuteronomy what did jesus say about the law in matt5 14 19 \? where did jesus say that the law only applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law \? who acknowledged this fact \? on what basis \? are we extra biblical at this point \? why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad gita is the only relevant text for gentiles , after all we see in the bible that it was magus from the east who observed the star signs of jesus \? why bother with any texts at all \? why not just follow whatever the church has to say \? i do n't see how you can say this with a straight face are you a follower of christ , or do you follow someone else \? are you saying that the words of jesus only apply to jews \? how jewish was paul after he changed his name from saul \? who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books \? who says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments \? you 're implying that jesus' words are valid only for jews is this really what you mean to say \? you do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the bible \? when you read jesus' words , did you ever consider that maybe , just maybe jesus is talking to you , no matter what your race or sex \? if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of jesus are only directed to jews , why were they translated into english \? as paul would call him , one who was weak in the faith which is more important 1 \) the recorded word of jesus or 2 \) indications that you can deduce from the bible \? was jesus god only of the jews , or god of all humankind of all race and sex \? this is your understanding of paul compare this to the word of jesus are you christian or pauline \? again , this is your understanding of paul did jesus say that the law was an impossible standard \? did jesus say that he superceded the law \? are you christian or pauline \? you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul what did jesus say \? can you deny that matt5 14 19 is quite clear in its meaning \? are you christian or pauline \? when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin \? please reread matt5 14 19 are you christian or pauline \? are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial details \? you call observance of the sabbath , the day on which the lord rested , ceremonial \? has circumcision been superceded for christians \? are you christian or pauline \? both there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not , at least not in this case jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles that 's why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion as to general jewish views on this , i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology , one by h j schoeps , and one whose author i ca n't come up with at the moment both authors are jews also , various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups mat 5 19 is clear that the law is still valid it does not say that it applies to gentiles and yes , i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail , when you 're looking at the obligations of gentiles similarly circumcision i'm not sure quite what else i can say on this subject again , it 's unfortunate the jesus did n't answer the question directly however we do know \( 1 \) what the 1st cent jewish approach was , \( 2 \) how jesus dealt with at least one gentile , and \( 3 \) how jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute \( i'm referring to acts 15 more than paul \) given that these are all in agreement , i do n't see that there 's a big problem
15	the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in 451 ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism , which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox it believes that jesus christ was god \( which is correct \) , that he was man \( which is correct \) , that he was one person \( which is correct \) , but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy \( which is heretical , the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies , both divine and human , though the wills were in perfect harmony \) that is what mike is trying to get across , that while jesus came in human form , mike says he did not have a human nature or a human will in reality , he had both , though neither made him subject to original sin it is interesting to note that the monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies it also was condemned , at a late council in constantinople i believe andy byler

5	i used to think this way , and not just about x for example , incorrect english constructs such as its raining or it 's window id annoy me however , there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world indeed , the fact that x won out over news was really down to popular opinion \( i know , we all think it 's \( ! \) technically superior as well ! \) on a related topic , who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour being irish , and hence using english english as opposed to american english , i always use the latter except , of course , for api terms such as xalloccolor and colormap in a world that uses the term windows to refer to microsoft windows , perhaps the time has come to accept x windows as a valid term for x i think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than , say , the x window system and , let 's face it , almost everyone uses it ultimately , we all need product sales to more than just x literate people in this respect , product recognition is important and a short , snappy , descriptive title \( x is positively obscure \) will help when dealing with the average punter \( it 's sad i thought i was a software engineer ! \) indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become popularly known as windows and let ms worry about whether it should be called microsoft windows or the microsoft window system or how about just plain microsoft ! to summarise \( or should that be summarize \) the point of this message i think there are far more pressing issues facing the x community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system \( or should that be windowing system \) whatever gets recognised is fine by me i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say however , i would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x window system

17	in my postings i have made a proposal for comments and discussion those who do n't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so however i would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner , legally responsible for their deeds i cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and i urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats ps my proposal has nothing to do with nazi eugenics it has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice i do n't consider that justice is done , when non jews who fled or were expelled in 1948 1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland this can at best be called pragmatism , a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong it can never be called justice and peace without justice will never be peace it is my conviction that the situation in which a state , through the law , attempts to discourage mixed marriages \( as israel does \) , is not normal such a state resembles more nazi germany and south africa than western democracies , such as the united states , in which jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands my proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything , just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage when the day will come and israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society , in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency , such a fund would not be needed any more i do n't mind if jews wish to marry jews and keep their traditions , why not \? but this is not the affairs of a state western democracy clearly separates these domains and i am certain that most american jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed christian state and to have their green cards stamped with a mark jew i would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional , infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that jews who respect judaism are uncivilized such behaviour is not good for judaism

19	in mcclaryc5snpq kb1 netcom com mcclary netcom com \( michael mcclary \) just thought i 'd clear up a few of the murky areas actually , after surviving being driven out of nauvoo , and later carthage , the mormons did fortify utah they still arm themselves to defend the faith , and stockpile food as well they have been involved in quite a lot of illegal activity including multiple \( and often underage \) wives for the leaders a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their sect the parallels between koresh and joseph smith are striking by they , you mean the leaders of the lds church \? i grant you that when joseph smith was still alive , plenty of accusations were filed , most of which had little bearing with reality , as evidenced by various verdicts i have studied lds history for 15 years now , and i have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved , in quote illegal activities plural marriage , yes , but your charge of underage wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid , and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families , unlike , as it appears , those of david koresh joseph smith started the sect after he and his brother hyram were murdered in a nauvoo , il jail cell , church membership split over who to follow initially , smith was considered a prophet \( just like mohammed , a rather interesting parallel considering muslims consider christ to be a prophet the same as jews , i'm led to understand make no mistake , this was no messiah we 're talking about in smith \) the and neither did he claim he was as the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders \( and especially those of joseph smith \) , i have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man , whose only crime was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision many have tried to explain the smith phenomenon away , but the bold presence of an 8 5 million member strong church stands as a witness that joseph smith 's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed down father to son after joseph smith died , his son was only entering his teens brigham young and a few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death the council of twelve , the church governing body , was n't of much help here , and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects brigham young took his followers to salt lake the rest waited for smith jr to grow up enough to assume leadership the other claimants to the leadership were soon ignored , like mike dukakis \) the rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the church , while the great majority of the membership , the twelve , and the various auxiliary organizations , chose to accept brigham young as the new prophet and leader of the church if you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine , you would have known that brigham young was the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smith 's vacancy he was the senior apostle in the quorum , and various comments made by joseph indicated that it was brigham who would lead the latter day exodus to the west other rightful heirs were either dead \( hyrum smith \) or excommunicated \( oliver cowdery \) , and while persecutions abounded and intensified , joseph smith had already given orders to look for a new place , an empty land beyond the boundaries of the united states \( at that time \) this rekhabite principle \( pseudographia \) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful , and was not questioned by them granted , a couple of do it yourselfers stayed behind , unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown , but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat the church benefitted from this purification process they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world both sects practiced the 1 year food stockpile doctrine , and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapons there is little evidence that they were a militaristic sect , given that they tended to move on rather than face large scale opposition brigham young , having suffered a great deal getting to salt lake , seems to have been quite justified in making military training a good thing remember , this was far beyond where even the us army went , and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves just a little context to put this all in perspective btw , since when is the church of jesus christ of latter day saints \( one of the largest denominations in the country \) a sect \? \? \? it did n't splinter from any other religion , as did say , the southern baptists or methodists so what did the mormons get \? it seems that j edgar hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets \( they 're pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood many actually do even to the point of suicide \) what a balloney suicide is sinful and against the law of god i am not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with mammon i assure you that many among us reject this attitude categorically period our only true allegiance is to our god and to the leaders which he has appointed to represent him in any regard , to read this trash \( about suicide and atone for sins with blood \) is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for the rlds , the reorganized lds , are friendly rivals of the lds and delight in telling stories about them , which generates quick retorts from the lds members and everybody has a grand time at no time have i ever even heard this hinted at i'm taking it with a salt block make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top so he hired virtually no one but mormons , until the fbi was almost exclusively staffed by members of the church of later day saints though j edgar is finally gone , the fbi personnel \( especially the field agents \) are still heavily mormon i have often wondered how this might affect the fbi 's treatment of religious organizations a mormon would consider heretical preposterous even if this were true \( reliable data , please \) , i am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct \( that 's why they were selected for in the first place , remember \? \) besides , one of our articles of faith strongly states the principle of freedom of religion , and that all people are free to worship how , where , or what they may if it 's true , there would be little affect lds and rlds philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true church as set down by jesus , but that god will judge each on his own merits in addition , the rlds also contend \( and the lds may as well \) that ignorance of the true way \( tm \) is an excuse you can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it in short , lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans to buddhists , secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance it is more likely that hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade alcohol , tobacco , hot drink \( like coffee or tea \) , and the like these people are the salt of the earth and as such are more easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them a good explanation , i can accept that you are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with mammon 's orders \( the late president kimball , for example , was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the mx peace keeper missile maze in utah \) that 's my somewhat educated guess , anyway both sects have splinter groups that do n't mirror the masses , but these are small and rare , and hardly worth noting their common ancestry none of this has any relevance to guns , though when a man 's religion is used to deny him the right of self protection with the weapons suitable for the job , he 'll find an ally in me dan sorenson , dod 1066 z1dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu isu only censors what i read , not what i say do n't blame them usenet post to exotic , distant machines meet exciting , unusual people and flame them

18	excellently put ! even as a libertarian , i have to admit government does do some things i like there is a beautiful performing arts complex in ft lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars \( i do n't know how much was private and how much was stolen , i mean public \) but it is beautiful and i enjoy it \( keep in mind , though , most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there , so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it \) however , i have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention power on a case by case basis in fact , we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case by case basis as much as other issues judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office they do not try to decide just whether pro nazi , pro choice , pro life , or pro tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office you can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case by case basis not so with economic issues government does tell taxi drivers exactly what they can charge , but not the bus lines or the lawyers just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case by case basis , we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case by case basis there is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise but there is no hope , in my opinion , of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an efficient manner i call it political market failure thus , if you value freedom and the abundance it produces , you have to swallow the whole libertarian agenda

15	the bible does tell us that governments are ordained by god \( romans 13 \) and furthermore , god foreknows everything that would happen it is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds , the inevitablity of the sucess of god 's plan , and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil however , though they are doing evil \( and we should not cooperate with them when they do such \) , it must be understood that what happens is what god wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of his plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible in short , the slaughter in bosnia , though deplorable in the eyes of god \( maybe , then again , they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later there are plenty of examples of god killing people for their sins onan in the old testmament for example , and annias and spahira in the new \) is what he willed to happen so that his plan might be accomplished but do n't forget , it is not unbiblical for god to use one nation to execute his just judgement upon another the romans were used to fulfill the chorus of let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd in jersualem and chaldea was chastised by babylon , which got israel , which was inturn gotten by persia , etc god does use nations to punish other nations , as the bible very clearly shows in the old testament do n't you remember the words of god recorded in daniel , mene , mene , tekel , peres \? babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of god 's justice , found severly wanting , and was thus given over to the persians as their due punishment for their rebellion another exammple is the extirmination of the cannanites , ordered by god as the task of israel the cannanites had been given their chance , found severly wanting , and the great judge , carried out his just sentence accrodingly i could go on with more examples , but i see little need to do so , as my point is quite clear two things need to be remembered at all times 1 \) it is not up to us to question why god has ordered the world as he has in his divine wisdom , he made the world as was best in his eyes , and like paul says in romans 9 , the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter 2 \) the message of jesus christ is as follows repent now , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand jesus christ did not allow any time for dilly dallying let the dead bury the dead , come , follow me there is not an infinite amount of time , rather christ is passing by right now , calling people to follow him and become fishers of men he does not say , well , alright , you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fits in with your plans he said follow me his message is not i'm just a sweety pie who would never hurt a fly , you 've got all the time in the world , and divine judgement , that 's only a fairy tale our great god and savior jesus christ \( titus 2 5 \) is also the just and righteous judge of the world and it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy

8	suggest mcquires 1 plastic polish it will help somewhat but nothing will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is mcquires will do something for fine or light stuff also suggest calling your local plastic shop in calif tap plastic is a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes replacement of plastic bits telephone in the bay area is 415 962 8430 i'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping i have found that they have several excellent products for cleaning , and removing crap from windscreens and face shields also they have one called lift it which works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic wihtout scratching same luck ,

0	one book i have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called man 's religions by john b noss it was a textbook in a class i had on comparative religion or some such thing it has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading it does n't compare religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities but nothing i have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or christian based in fact , christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages the book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began \( india , east asia , near east \) there is nothing about new world religions from the aztecs , mayas , incas , etc just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays and a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way
10	actually , this part was really interesting it turns out that the mask is custom fit to the goalie 's face the goalie puts his her face through a piece of wood \( or was it plastic \? \) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show hair is covered by a cap , eyes are covered by a plastic wrap type material , and vaseline is put on the goaltender 's face then , a plaster is spread on their cheeks , forehead , and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently when it dries , it is effectively a mold of the goalie 's face this is used as the basis of the mask \( the rest involves padding the inside , hardening the exterior , fitting the cage , etc etc john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show yeah , essensa 's mask looked really good actually , i thought i heard him say that it was potvin 's for certain i would bet money on it either way and it did look awesome !

18	fucking news reader i do n't think this got posted if it did , ignore it this time \( a response to korey \) begin my response maybe because the claims deserve refute \? the above abstract lists various possible links to cannabis use \( unfiltered almost guaranteed \) and lung problems someone may get overly excited when they see that article , but without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered their data it really does n't tell you shit i'm going to track down that study hopefully tomarrow what justifies the truth about drugs \? research \? what sort of research \? correlational data can help establish a theory , but it does not prove anything heroin is a relatively safe drug what makes it unsafe are iv administration and shit like adulterants there are side effects , like withdrawal , but they effect people differently stereotypical statement i know people who use heroin and opiates that function just fine in society name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically no , no , no \( or at least i have n't been arguing this \) there is not enough data to form a scientific conclusion that does n't mean that cannabis is benign to users' lungs we can form all the theories we want , but they are only theories some theories are supported by more evidence than others , and that makes them stronger the hell i ca n't ! they state un justified conclusions as fact as a political strategy to stop drug use in general , i somewhat see what you 're saying and people like jack herer contribute to this this has been quite a big mind fuck for me recently , and i 've pretty came to the conclusion that you ca n't trust anybody by word of mouth alone my attitude about the general population has decreased significantly gotta run to class marc andersom spot colorado edu

14	better idea for use of nasa shuttle astronauts and crew is have them be found lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space time glitch maybe age jemison a few years \( makeup and such \) and have her as the only survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost heh of late , they way they have been having shuttle problems in the media , anything can happen imagine a astronaut crew member to find themselves in the 24th century as the object of interest of an alien civilization , maybe rescued or helped by the st enterprise i know vegr and such was okay , but this could be better

7	i would suggest you take the car to the nearest chevron dealer , with your own oil and filter ask for an oil change it will cost less than 10 watch him her do it just from watching someone do a job , you will be able to learn and remember the sequence , and do it right when you do it yourself the next time besides , when he she loosens the drain nut , the next time around it will be easier for you if it is stuck , use an impact wrench not too much force though use a new washer each time you put the nut back

5	some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could , but the server did not create cursors of that size investigation showed that some x servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window , while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size the interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok , while a sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32 so far i 've also seen this behavior on ncd and phase x x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps actually , the ncd is even more liberal sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as ok is xquerybestcursor semi broken or is this behavior correct \? i 'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor !

2	we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w4wg for a while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcp ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that 's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i do n't know if it is ms mail , the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax , the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary \( error garbage code stuff \) if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem , the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only 175 00 for one support call \( until problem is worked out \) phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew , please drop me a note anyone the next itteration is supposed to have tcp ip built in they say the netxt itteration of w4wg good luck ! ! ! ! !

15	according to mdbs ms uky edu , muslims tithe 1 6 of their income perhaps there are some offshoots of islam that impose this on their followers but the standard tithe is 1 40 of one 's net worth , once a year the same writer also objects to the bible for teaching that woman was created after man , to be his helper etc this is presumably a reference to genesis 2 suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed we have god creating woman , and then saying , it is not good that woman should be alone i will make a help meet for her feminists would be outraged the clear implication would be that god had started at the bottom and worked up , making first the plants , then the fish and birds , then the beasts , then woman , and finally his masterpiece , the male chauvinist pig the statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself , that she needs a man to open doors for her , would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult the fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general , while the creation of the man was given in six times the number of words , would have been cited as evidence of the author 's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes the verdict would have been unequivocal no self respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide , or as anything but sexist trash ! i suggest that moses , fearing this reaction , altered his original draft and described the creation with adam first and then eve , so as to appease miriam and other radical feminists of the day for some reason , however , it did not work

19	in article 93109 231733isscck byuvm bitnet casper c knies isscck byuvm b as a latter day saint , i found john 's statement not at all ludicrous please allow me to explain myself in 1838 , the governor of missouri , governor boggs , issued his so called mormon extermination order the only crime \( illegal activity \) the latter day saints had committed , was their religious affiliation , their anti slave stance \( missouri still allowed slave practices \) , and their growing numbers influence in missouri i guess the mormons got what they deserved , because they refused to bow to the will of \( corrupt and evil \) secular authorities this disobedience brought upon them persecution , murder , and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by average people , and that at the time , almost all americans were pretty homogeonously christian it was largely the mainstream christian 's disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred true , but that is exactly the problem the mormon extermination order was issued not just by a christian , it was allowed under the constitution of the united states , which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this order from occurring in the first place as i indicated in an earlier posting , your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by individuals like robert weiss \( who could have been gov boggs' lieutenant he would have fitted right in , drewling et al \) , and seems a modern day occurrence , based on results \( slander , persecution , misrepresentation , lies , denying mormons representation in their own user group , etc etc in intent and purpose , what really has changed \? the situation is not entirely different today many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion i do n't think most of them are started because of religion , but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought true , as evidenced by numerous examples , as i am sure you 're aware in any regard , mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities \( and i do n't even discuss how uthan 's were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nerve gas and atomic bomb testing grounds \) is far from being trusted or righteous have things really changed for the better \? i may be a born cynic , but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been the case in the early 1980s , i believe , the late president kimball \( lds church leader \) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mx peace keeper missile maze from being built in utah \( yet another inspired decision from secular authorities \) fortunately , his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing eradicating the mormons \? do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for nuclear testing etc was to get them thar mormons \? and what about the majority of uthan 's who are n't mormons \? you seem to be searching for enemy \( correction the majority of utahn 's are mormon \( 60 70 i believe , up to a 100 in many cities and settlements throughout the western states \) conspiracies it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose what i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched , as we believe that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth , judgment , and justice in addition , we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous \( greed for money would be a good example \) in order to bring about persecution , war , oppression , and evil combinations as an intelligent being , do n't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power \? as far as utah is concerned , what i pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities , which have brought death , disease , \( i e the downwinders \) and environmental contami nation i am hardly paranoid , i am just not expecting too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith , and which indeed \( as gov boggs et al \) may be out to harm and destroy us as a matter of fact , prophecies in my church indicate that in future years , \( global \) persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope , that \( paraphrasing \) all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion zion \( the pure in heart \) will be re established in those days , and it ai n't our current secular authorities who will rule over it david koresh did not pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation , and with john , i too wonder who or what 's next i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person sure , he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers that much is definite hmmm definite by whom \? until such has been established beyond reason able doubt , this alleged threat may have been less than the threat imposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbi who killed who \? what constitutional right did the atf officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound \? what really caused the murder of the little children \? could it be that the atf fbi presence has any bearing upon the events \? how would you interpret the mt masada events \? blame the jews \? \( what the heck did the romans do there anyway \? what business did the atf fbi has in waco , texas \? \? \? \) the branch davidians never posed any threat to society this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic team in 1976 \? in that case , the police botched the job as well but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case certainly , if david koresh chose any peaceful option , the atf and fbi would have complied the responsibility is more his than the authorities come now , at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise peaceful stand off let 's get it over with , and force david koresh to come out \? \? \? by gassing them \? \? \? were they naive , or what \? they played right into the hands of an apocalyptic thinking individual \( he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years \) , and not one firetruck or plan was in place to deal with this scenario \? \? \? i feel that the authorities had some responsibility to protect their own citizens , even if they were religious zealots , and guilty of not paying a 200 gun license \? \? \? \( has the batf become an extension of the local tax collectors \? \) david koresh , no doubt , will be described as the evil guy \( by the executioners \) , while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers characterizing the atf fbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair in order to be an executioner , the least one must have done is have the intent to kill que \? \? intrusion into private property with semi 's , loaded with life ammunition , is n't that implicit intent \( or at least prepared \) to kill \? i ask you , would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice \?

7	anyone have figures or pointers to references about how fast much car prices have gone up in the last decade \?
16	is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property , such as a farm \? here in the united states , the license is required only for the use of public roads we also have a nation of 250 million people , many issues and usually only two candidates for a given office a president might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de facto ban \( something a majority of the people would object to \) and still be elected the voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities , health care , etc and vote for the lesser of two evils i do n't think this is a matter of paranoia , since local governments in \( for example \) new york and chicago have abused existing , mild gun control laws to create a virtual ban in which case , the united states already has adaquate gun control laws according to federal statistic , only 7 of gun wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers if that 's the point of gun control \( to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns \) then america does n't need any additional laws to accomplish this how is this any different from guns \? there are legal purposes for owning and using a gun they are appropriate tools for hunting , target shooting and self defence like cars , murder is n't their only \( or even a common \) use i certainly could n't imagine the american public accepting regulation of axes while the politics of other nations may be different , in america there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average , law abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong a good way to deal with which problem \? it is an excelent way to deal with the short term problem of rioting and violent attacks of course , it does n't do anything for the long term issues that start riots but at this point , what can these individuals do about long term social problems \? there are , according to surveys , guns in 40 of american homes in many parts of the country , this is closer to 100 those places where almost everyone owns a gun are , on average , safer than those where guns are less common this is , i think , a fundamental difference between american government and that of other nations here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average , law abiding citizen in the name of some vague common good

comments news from the editor i would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the mednews ocr scanner fund we have reached our goal ! a hewlett packard scanjet iip was purchased this week thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again , thank you to all who gave ! i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows 3 1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software , it lets you select several options \( 1 \) text graphics \( 2 \) input source ie scanner , fax file , disk file \( 3 \) automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned , and in what order once an image is scanned , you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability , but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade , which are words that wordscan plus does n't think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct , instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue , you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words i find this to be very limited , considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted , you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 an intel satisfaxtion card , which stores incoming faxs in a pcx dcx format while most of my faxes were received in standard mode \( 200x100 dpi \) , the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent overall , a very impressive product the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary 200 specialized words is just too small if anyone has any specific questions ,

42 \( 14 \) date apr 16 , 1993 introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem \( 1 \) , infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early 1970s , the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes \( e g , escherichia coli o157 h7 , hepatitis c virus , human immunodeficiency virus , legionnaires disease , lyme disease , and toxic shock syndrome \) the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control , such as cholera , malaria , and tuberculosis \( tb \) , have increased in many areas furthermore , control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea , malaria , pneumococcal disease , salmonellosis , shigellosis , tb , and staphylococcal infections \( 2 \) emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons , those in institutional settings \( e g , hospitals and child day care centers \) , and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \( 3 \) this issue of mmwr introduces a new series , emerging infectious diseases future articles will address these diseases , as well as surveillance , control , and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health officials this first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of e coli o157 h7 in the western united states \( 4 \) references 1 burnet m natural history

during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers \( 2 \) this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus , the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef , although other food vehicles , including roast beef , raw milk , and apple cider , also have been implicated \( 3 \) preliminary data from a cdc 2 year , nationwide , multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o157 h7 that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7 8 of all bloody stools , a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o157 h7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page 7 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 smac medium , and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection \( 4 \) the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \( often bloody \) and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after 6 8 days , but 2 7 of patients develop hus , which is characterized by hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , renal failure , and a death rate of 3 5 this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o157 h7 in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak , the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington \( 1 \) clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o157 h7 using smac agar \( 5 \) when infections with e coli o157 h7 are identified , they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and , if necessary , public health action to prevent further cases e coli o157 h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle , and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture 's food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o157 h7 entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens , and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior , ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink , and the juices are clear in this outbreak , undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration \( fda \) has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 f \( 86 1 c \) \( fda , personal communication , 1993 \) regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o157 h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli o157 h7 references 1 cdc preliminary report foodborne outbreak of escherichia coli o157 h7 infections from hamburgers western united states , 1993

12	here is a different viewpoint in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed with inkjet because smudges etc can happen a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long does the first sheet take to print \? inkjets are faster than you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the printer \( i have a 486 33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the printer \) a sage said to me do you want one copy or lots of copies \? , one , inkjet paper cost is the same and both can use refills long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts \( consumables \) and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet driver there is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer this means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot few drivers actually use this facility \( there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on \)

15	hello , i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup , and i think that they can be used to explain each other unfortunately i do n't have direct quotes handy 1 \) atheists believe that when they die , they die forever 2 \) a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair i do n't see what the problem is ! to christians , hell is , by definition , eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die there 's no reason hell has to be especially awful to most people , eternal death is bad enough literal interpreters of the bible will have a problem with this view , since the bible talks about the fires of hell and such personally , i do n't think that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus with a double edged sword issuing from his mouth i treat both these statements as metaphorical

19	the problem is , your use of the word objective along with values both definitions three and four are inherently subjective , that is they are particular to a given individual , or personal you see , what one person may see as worthwhile , another may see as worthless again , your form of measurement in this sentence , that being of worth is subjective when i find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person , i try to find a standard against which to judge that usage in most cases , the dictionary is the standard i use here is a definiton of objective objective adj 1 of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept 2 having actual existance 3 a unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b based on observable phenomenon by this definition , science does not have an objective worth , since the phrase objective worth is an oxymoron however you asked something a little differently this time , you asked for an objective basis for a notion the fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world \( the changes are material , and thus objective \) would provide an objective basis for an argument however , the conclusion arrived at from that argument \( that science is good \) is subjective i think that the problem here is one of word usage take a little time and read the definitions of these words objective , subjective , worth , value , morality , good , evil i believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while , you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality

15	pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup i would describe myself as an agnostic , in so far as i'm sure there is no single , universal supreme being , but if there is one and it is just , we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives , striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us now , the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist that would normally be a non issue with me , but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me \( which i guess it is , according to his faith \) this is a great strain to our friendship i would have no problem if the subject did n't come up , but when it does , the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us he is offended because i call into question his bedrock beliefs i am offended by what i feel is a subscription to superstition , rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the bible is god 's word because he tells us in the bible that it is so ' so my question is , how can i convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed , so we can preserve what is \( in all areas other than religious beliefs \) a great friendship \? how do i convince him that i am 'beyond saving' so he wo n't try \? thanks for any advice

2	greetings ! i 've had a bunch of problems with the 24x opening a dos window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows blowing up into a set of horizontal lines , hashing the entire desktop nothing can recover this except to completely exit from windows the other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling , as if a cr was printed without an lf this seems only to happen to communications programs , but i ca n't nail it down any further than that note , though , that the comms programs do n't have to be communicating even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows , wpwin would sometimes blow up , and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem i 've still seen this , but only once or twice with wpwin 5 2

0	why do babies get diseases , etc here 's the \( main \) problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent , but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it , but indicates something far different the earth , by latest estimates , is about 4 6 billion years old , and has had life for about 3 5 billion of those years humans have only been around for \( at most \) about 200 , 000 years but , the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving , and , in fact , disease ridden , long before there were people \( yes , there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders , of course , but there are some \) heck , not just fossil evidence , but what we 've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long , long time if human sin was what brought about disease \( at least , indirectly , though necessarily \) then how could it exist before humans \? deletions uh i know of many evolutionary biologists , who know more about biology than you claim to , who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code \( or any other \) 'started off' in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment , in a collective sense i'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code' umm nah , we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria , and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size , but the ranks keep changing for example , bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease , i'm sure you 'll agree but it still pops up from time to time , even today and does n't do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation , but even when people get the disease , the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago , and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed' , \( forgive the poor terminology , i'm an engineer , not a doctor ! \) and died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this , but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old , and used to be nastier , though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty w age now , wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect , right \? and , you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan , who 's making the diseases , would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal , if he wants survivors as far as i can see , our immune systems , imperfect though they may \( presently \? \) be , must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not , at the time of design , necessary \? that is , god made our immune systems ahead of time , knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases \? here 's another puzzle what , exactly , do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase , 'created perfect and without flaw' \? to my mind , a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time a 'perfect' system that will , without constant intervention , become imperfect is not a perfect system at least , imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer 's glue \? that is , the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect , but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart \? if so , why could god not have used better materials \? was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself , of did it just choose not to \? deletions my main point , as i said , was that there really is n't any evidence for the explanation you give \( at least , that i'm aware of \) but , i could n't help making a few nitpicks here and there sincerely ,

10	you might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak that pens streak is a playoff streak \( tied by the chicago blackhawks , who had won 11 in a row until they met the pens in the finals last year \) the 18 game unbeaten , so far , is a regular season unbeaten streak but hey , do n't take it personally i'm a flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch but with a healthy lindros , recchi , brind'amour and tommy soderstrom , they 'll be there next year ! by the way , since the flyers need defenseman , what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that terry carkner wo n't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense

15	i agree with what darren has to say here , but would like to add a personal observation what i see as arrogance and the problem i have with it is not a sense of personal certainty , but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions clearly , this is not just christian vs non christian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within christianity i do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because , like aesthetics , it is not demonstable by objective means choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty what bothers me is when others suggest that , in these matters of faith , their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others it follows from this that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth , and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others it is universalizing those matters of personal faith , coupled by a proud notion that one 's relationship with god is superior to other 's , that leads to arrogance in my honest \( and nonuniversal \) opinion \) comments , criticism welcome ken alvin ucsu colorado edu

15	i 'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of christians and look forward to any responses in my encounters with christians , i find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth according to them , their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of god and god is truth thus they know the truth this stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about christianity because they see no other way their way is the 'truth ' but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice is part faith and part reason , but it seems to me a choice my discussions with some christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when i was in grade school a kid would say , all policemen are jerks ! i 'd ask , how do you know \? because my daddy told me so ! how do you know you 're daddy is right \? he says he 's always right ! well the argument usually stops right there in the end , are n't we all just kids , groping for the truth \? if so , do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false \? this is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup i apologize if i'm covering tired old ground some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and i welcome any comments i'm sort of mystified about how a christian might respond to this i can understand criticisms of christianity that say there 's not enough evidence to believe it , or that there 's just as good evidence for other religions i do n't agree , but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who do n't find the evidence convincing but that does n't seem to be your point rather , you seem upset that people who believe christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false this suggests a model of spiritual things that 's rather different than the christian one it sounds more like an existentialist view , where people choose what value to follow , but there 's no actual independent spiritual reality , and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right this sort of model with modifications of one sort or another may be appropriate for some religions but christianity is in its essense a historical religion that is , it 's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there , that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways , and that we see evidence of that in history in the mundane world , we are not free to choose how things work when we drop something , it falls \( aside from well defined situations where it does n't \) the christian concept is that spiritual matters , there is also an actual external reality i hope we 're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding but while we may not think we know everything , we are confident that we know some things and that implies that we think things that contradict them are false i do n't see how else we could proceed this need n't result in arrogance i'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions they may have things to teach me , and even if they do n't , i respect them as fellow human beings but it 's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong maybe even disasterously wrong
